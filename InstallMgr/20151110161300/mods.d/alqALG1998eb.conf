About=Algonquin New Testament About Algonquin Algonquin is one of the Algonquian languages of Canada in the same family as Cree, Ojibwe, Naskapi and Atikamekw. It is locally known as Anicinabemowin. It is spoken in northwestern Quebec in 9 communities in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, and one community in Ontario. Like other languages in Quebec introduced to Christianity by the Roman Catholic Church, it is written using Roman script instead of the syllabic script used in Cree, Ojibwe and various other Algonquian languages in Canada. About This Translation The translation represented by this text was started under the auspices of the North American Branch of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in 1975. SIL staff worked in close partnership with members of the Algonquin First Nation at Pikogan and with the Roman Catholic Church. The Canadian Bible Society provided consultant and publishing support to this project and published the New Testament in 1998. The translation team also produced weekly lectionary readings for the Church.
