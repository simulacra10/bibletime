About=    Ika (ikk) Nigeria In Nigeria the word Ika is not only the name of the Ika         people, but is also used to designate a local government area in the Akwa Ibom         State. The Ika people are a sub group of the Igbo people. It is interesting to note         that Ika is the name of a town in Croatia is one of the eight Annang local         government areas of the local government areas in Akwa Ibom State. An alternative         name for the Ika people is Ika-Annang. There appears to be another dialect of Ika         that is spoken in Delta State of Nigeria.
