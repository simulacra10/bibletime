About=    Wycliffe’s Bible with Modern Spelling, was made in response to requests from readers who wanted my Wycliffe’s Old and New Testaments and Apocrypha in one volume. Printing limitations dictated the number of pages available to me and the letter size. In my previous books, Wycliffe’s Bible, Wycliffe’s Old Testament, Vols. 1 amp 2, Wycliffe’s New Testament, and Wycliffe’s Apocrypha, I have tens of thousands of rewritten verses, presented in parentheses “( )”, to provide help in comprehending the 14th century Middle English vocabulary and grammar. In this present volume, with space at a premium, those “helps” had to be eliminated, to make room for the text of the Apocrypha.
