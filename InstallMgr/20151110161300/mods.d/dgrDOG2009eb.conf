About=    Tłı̨chǫ Genesis and New Testament    About Tłı̨chǫ    Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) is a Na-Dene (Athabaskan) language. It is spoken by the First Nations Tłı̨chǫ people in the Northwest Territories in Canada. It has the largest number of speakers of any of the Aboriginal language communities in the NWT, and is one of the official languages of the Northwest Territories.    About This Translation    This translation includes the book of Genesis and the New Testament in Tłı̨chǫ. The first edition of the Tłı̨chǫ New Testament was published in 2003. It was a historic event, as it was the first time in more than a hundred years that a complete New Testament was published for one of the Dene First Nations in the Territories. The first edition was well received and quickly sold out. In the meantime the book of Genesis had been completed. Consequently, the 2008 reprint of the Tłı̨chǫ New Testament included Genesis.    Though this translation of the New Testament and Genesis took a total of ten years, the people who worked on it built on years of labor invested by the Tłı̨chǫ people, elders, priests and missionaries, translators, educators, and linguists. The material contained in this book was checked and approved by consultants from Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Canadian Bible Society.    If you are interested in obtaining a printed copy of this Bible, please contact the Canadian Bible Society at http://www.biblescanada.com.
