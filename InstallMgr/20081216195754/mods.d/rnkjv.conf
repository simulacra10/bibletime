About=Restored Name King James Version\par The RNKJV uses the KJV but restores the names of God to their original forms.  For example, where the KJV renders yod-he-vav-he (YWHW) "the LORD", the RNKJV renders it yod-he-vav-he.  Similarly, other Hebrew names like "Elohim" (God/Mighty One(s)) are left in their Hebrew form.  The Greek work "Iesous" (Jesus) is also restored to its Hebrew/Aramaic form: "Yahushua".\par\par Visit http://www.eliyah.com/ for more information.
