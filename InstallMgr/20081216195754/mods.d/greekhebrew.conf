Description=Greek to Hebrew Dictionary of Septuagint Words
About=Greek to Hebrew Dictionary of Septuagint Words\par This lexicon contains Greek words found in the Septuagint and also found in the NT. These are coded to Strong's. The lexicon also contains the equivalent Hebrew words which the Septuagint has translated. The Hebrew words are also coded to Strong's. The benefit is that one can find the in depth meaning of all these OT Hebrew words thus providing a link between the NT greek and OT Hebrew. (Due acknowledgment is given to Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament by Abbot-Smith and Hatch and Redpath Concordance to the Septuagint).\par By Pierre Leblanc
