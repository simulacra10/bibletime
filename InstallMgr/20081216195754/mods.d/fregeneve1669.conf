About=Le Nouveau Testament de la Bible de Genève de 1669.\par\par Source text obtained in October 2015 from http://biblegeneve.com/nt1669/ \par supplemented in a few places using the text read from scanned pages \par in the zip download from http://www.fichier-zip.com/2013/03/31/bible-geneve-1669-bibliorama-fr/ \par\par The orthography has some quirks, such as "f" in words such as in "Paul prifonnier de Jefus Chrift".\par The original would have used the archaic long letter "ſ".\par Reverting these could not be easily scripted because the letter "f" is also part of the French alphabet.\par A dictionary based approach might be feasible, but there would still be many cases that require a human decision \par (e.g. "fera" vs "ſera").\par Some spellings are inconsistent. \par The italics markup in Luc was missing.
