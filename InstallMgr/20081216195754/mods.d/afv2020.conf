About=A Faithful Version—that reflects the true meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek with fidelity and word for word accuracy, showing the unity of Scripture between the Old and New Testaments. Today, in the face of rampant religious confusion, those who read and study the English Bible deserve a quality translation that can be trusted. Most importantly, hundreds of errors of the KJV have been corrected. Thus, making this Bible the most accurate English translation to date.\par\par \
