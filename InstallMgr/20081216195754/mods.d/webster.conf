About=THE HOLY BIBLE,\par CONTAINING THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS,\par IN THE COMMON VERSION.\par WITH AMENDMENTS OF THE LANGUAGE,\par BY NOAH WEBSTER, LL. D.\par\par -------------\par NEW HAVEN:\par PUBLISHED BY DURRIE & PECK.\par Sold by HEZEKIAH HOWE & CO., and A. H. MALTBY, New Haven;\par and by N.&J. WHITE, New York.\par\par ------\par 1833\par\par Webster Bible Electronic Format.\par PUBLIC DOMAIN\par\par February 1992\par\par Beginning in July of 1991 the task of placing the Webster Bible text in electronic format began.  The original purpose was to provide Larry Pierce, who produces the On-Line Bible program, with a more modern *public domain* text, similar in content and style to the AV but with a grammar that would provide better comprehension in todays English.\par\par I plan on maintaining an accurate copy of the Webster text.  Anyone finding an error should contact me; Anyone desiring to obtain the latest, most correct text, can find it on the Bible Foundation BBS, or can contact me in the following methods:\par 	Internet			acus10@waccvm.corp.mot.com\par 	Home phone		602-829-8542\par  Address		Mark Fuller\par 				1129 East Loyola Drive\par 				Tempe Arizona, 85282\par 	Bible Foundation	http://www.bf.org\par\par I would like to thank the Bible Foundation not only for scanning nearly the entire Webster Bible but for encouraging me to undertake this monumental work; particularly around page 20 when I realized what I had gotten myself into.  Special thanks to Jerry Kingery of the Bible Foundation for scanning, and Jerry Hastings for doing some preliminary scan cleaning and making the texts available on the BBS.
