Description=The Emphatic Diaglott
About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."\par\par Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are listed in the Preface.\par\par Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.\par\par Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed that this work is free from faults and errors.\par\par Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (1942)\par\par Text from http://www.biblestudentslibrary.org/ used by permission.
