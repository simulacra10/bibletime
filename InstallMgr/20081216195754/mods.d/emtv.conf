About=English Majority Text Translation of the Holy Bible (EMTV)\par Copyright © 2002 By Paul W. Esposito\par Used by permission of the copyright holder\par Courtesy of Stauros Ministries.\par\par The Byzantine Majority New Testament draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and this edition has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings.\par
