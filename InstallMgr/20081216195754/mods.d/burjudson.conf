CopyrightNotes=The header in each of the XML files claims copyright by Myanmar Bible Society. Source files for the translations hosted by Myanmar Bibles were generated by a script. viz. "Converted into OSIS by text2osis.pl. Source text was typed in WinResearcher and converted to Unicode using TecKIT."  Yet having been published in 1835, the Judson Bible text must be Public Domain. The conversion to Unicode 5.1 and formating as XML are the modern actions. Such format shifting is not a copyrightable action in most jurisdictions.
Notes=1. Made from the merged OSIS XML file derived from the 66 individual XML files. \
   This repaired several osisID errors and also included a general tidy up. \
2. Missing verses: Numbers 8:26, II Kings 11:21, I Chronicles 9:35-44, II Chronicles 36:22-23. \
   These have been reported to Myanmar Bibles. Still awaiting a response. \
3. Psalms 58:12 text is appended to Psalms 58:11, verse 12 being not in the KJV versification. \
   There are also 125 linked verses in total, as listed in osis2mod.rawtext.log \
4. There are 281 text differences regarding U+1025 MYANMAR LETTER U and U+1009 MYANMAR LETTER NYA. \
   i.e. compared to the text of the BurJudson module version 1.1. \
   These two characters have some visual similarity, so they may be typographical errors. \
   Whether the new text or the old is correct in these locations is still unresolved. \
   This issue has not yet been reported in detail to Myanmar Bibles. \
5. There are 12 further unresolved minor text differences at identified locations. \
   These have not yet been reported to Myanmar Bibles. \
6. With the exception of I Samuel, each book contains an afterword division. \
   These titles appear after the last verse of the last chapter in each book. \
   Such titles are not filtered by switching off OSISHeadings.
