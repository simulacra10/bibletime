About=This translation started in 1831 and was published in 1850 by the Orthodox Archimandrite and professor of the National University of Athens, Neophytos Vamvas with the help of other researchers. Considering that the Greek Orthodox Church wouldn't support him, he collaborated with the British and Foreign Bible Society to publish this translation.\par The text is written in "kathareuousa", a form of greek that is not spoken today in Greece. It is closer to spoken greek though, than the Septuagint (also known "translation of the seventy").
