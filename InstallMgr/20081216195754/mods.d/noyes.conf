Description=1869 Noyes Translation
About=A translation of the Greek New Testament of Tischendorf into English by George R. Noyes, originally published in 1869 by the American Unitarian Association. The Old Testament portion is limited to the books of Job through Malachi.\par\par In most Bible texts, italics are used to indicate words supplied by the translator. In this translation italics are instead used to indicate emphasis. Explanatory comments provided by the translator as well as readings with limited manuscript evidence are enclosed in square brackets "[ ]".\par\par The reader will note that in the middle of many verses words are capitalized which otherwise would be grammatically incorrect. Noyes used a "poetic structure" for many of his verses. Each line of the verse began with a capital. In restructuring these multi-line verses into single line verses the original capitalization was retained.
