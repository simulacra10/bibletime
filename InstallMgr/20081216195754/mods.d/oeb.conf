Description=Open English Bible (US Spelling)
About=The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:\par\par under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.\par\par The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.\par\par As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.\par\par\par Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org
