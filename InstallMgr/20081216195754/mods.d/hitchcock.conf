About=HITCHCOCK'S BIBLE NAMES DICTIONARY\par\par This dictionary is from "Hitchcock's New and Complete Analysis of the Holy Bible," published in the late 1800s.  It contains well over 2,500 Bible and Bible-related proper names and their meanings which you can search using a word processor. Some Hebrew words of uncertain meaning have been left out.  It is out of copyright, so feel free to copy and distribute it. I pray it will help in your study of God's Word.\par\par -- BRH
