Description=The Book of Jasher
About=The Book of Jasher is a spurious text purporting to be the "Book of Jasher" referred to in Joshua and 2Samuel in some older translations. This text, more properly called Pseudo-Jasher, was first published in 1751, falsely purporting to be a translation into English by Alcuin. Its printer, Jacob Ilive, was imprisoned in 1756, in part for having perpetrated the fraud of publishing this text.\oar This text is now considered among the modern pseudepigrapha and thus not even among the authentic apocrypha.
