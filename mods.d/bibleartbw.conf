About=This module contains black and white Bible artwork from multiple artists. It currently contains works by Gustave Dore, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Lucas Cranach, Albrecht Durer, and Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn.  It is intended that one day it will have a sister module of color paintings. \par\parThe Bible woodcuts by Gustave Dore: \parThese images are available due to the gracious magnanimity of Felix Just, S.J., who is responsible for having scanned them for us all: \par\par "Since these illustrations are well over 100 years old, they are in the `public domain' and are thus free of copyright; but since I took the trouble to scan them and make them available on the web, I would appreciate receiving appropriate credit and acknowledgements.  Thus, I encourage anyone to copy, print, download, distribute, or otherwise use these illustrations for any non-commercial purpose, especially for educational and/or religious uses; but please credit me by name (Felix Just, S.J.), include the URL of this page (http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Dore.htm), and/or link to it from your webpages. Thanks!" \par\par Many, many thanks to him from all of us. \par\par SWORD assembly by Brian J. Dumont (brian dot j dot dumont at gmail dot com) starting from a module of Dore woodcuts by Karl Kleinpaste.  Please send corrections to this email.
