About=The Bible woodcuts by Gustave Dore \par\par These images are available due to the gracious magnanimity of Felix Just, S.J., who is responsible for having scanned them for us all: \par\par "Since these illustrations are well over 100 years old, they are in the `public domain' and are thus free of copyright; but since I took the trouble to scan them and make them available on the web, I would appreciate receiving appropriate credit and acknowledgements.  Thus, I encourage anyone to copy, print, download, distribute, or otherwise use these illustrations for any non-commercial purpose, especially for educational and/or religious uses; but please credit me by name (Felix Just, S.J.), include the URL of this page (http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Dore.htm), and/or link to it from your webpages. Thanks!" \par\par Many, many thanks to him from all of us.
