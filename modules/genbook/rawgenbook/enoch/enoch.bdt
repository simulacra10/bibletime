  <hi type="super">1</hi> The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous, who
  will be <hi type="super">2</hi> living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be
  removed. And he took up his parable and said -Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were
  opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed
  me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for
  this generation, but for a remote one which is <hi type="super">3</hi> for to come. Concerning the elect I said,
  and took up my parable concerning them:

    <title>Chapter 2</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> Observe ye everything that takes place in the heaven, how they do not change their
  orbits, and the luminaries which are in the heaven, how they all rise and set in order each
  in its season, and <hi type="super">2</hi> transgress not against their appointed order. Behold ye the earth, and
  give heed to the things which take place upon it from first to last, how steadfast they are,
  how none of the things upon earth <hi type="super">3</hi> change, but all the works of God appear to you.
  Behold the summer and the winter, how the whole earth is filled with water, and clouds
  and dew and rain lie upon it.

  
    <title>Chapter 3</title>


  Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they had withered and
  shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage but retain the
  old foliage from two to three years till the new comes.

  
    <title>Chapter 4</title>


  And again, observe ye the days of summer how the sun is above the earth over against it.
  And you seek shade and shelter by reason of the heat of the sun, and the earth also burns
  with growing heat, and so you cannot tread on the earth, or on a rock by reason of its
  heat.

  
    <title>Chapter 5</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> Observe ye how the trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit: wherefore
  give ye heed and know with regard to all His works, and recognize how He that liveth for
  ever hath made them so. <hi type="super">2</hi> And all His works go on thus from year to year for ever, and all
  the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and their tasks change not, but according as God
  hath ordained so is it done. <hi type="super">3</hi> And behold how the sea and the rivers in like manner
  accomplish and change not their tasks from His commandments'.

    <title>Chapter 6</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were
  born unto <hi type="super">2</hi> them beautiful and comely daughters.  And the angels, the children of the
  heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another:  'Come, let us choose us wives
  from among the children of men <hi type="super">3</hi> and beget us children.'  And Semjaza, who was their
  leader, said unto them:  'I fear ye will not <hi type="super">4</hi> indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall
  have to pay the penalty of a great sin.'  And they all answered him and said:  'Let us all
  swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations <hi type="super">5</hi> not to abandon this plan
  but to do this thing.'  Then sware they all together and bound themselves <hi type="super">6</hi> by mutual
  imprecations upon it.  And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of
  Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they
  had sworn <hi type="super">7</hi> and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.  And these are the
  names of their leaders:  Samlazaz, their leader, Araklba, Rameel, Kokablel, Tamlel,
  Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, <hi type="super">8</hi> Asael, Armaros, Batarel, Ananel,
  Zaqiel, Samsapeel,
  Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel.  These are their chiefs of tens.

    
    <title>Chapter 7</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for
  himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and
  they taught them charms <hi type="super">2</hi> and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them
  acquainted with plants.  And they <hi type="super">3</hi> became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose
  height was three thousand ells:  Who consumed <hi type="super">4</hi> all the acquisitions of men.  And when
  men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against <hi type="super">5</hi> them and devoured
  mankind.  And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and <hi type="super">6</hi> fish, and to
  devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood.  Then the earth laid accusation against the
  lawless ones.


  
    <title>Chapter 8</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and
  made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets,
  and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of
  costly stones, and all <hi type="super">2</hi> colouring tinctures.  And there arose much godlessness, and they
  committed fornication, and they <hi type="super">3</hi> were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways.
  Semjaza taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, 'Armaros the resolving of enchantments,
  Baraqijal (taught) astrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the
  clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course
  of the moon.  And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven .  .  .

  
    <title>Chapter 9</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw much
  blood being <hi type="super">2</hi> shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth.  And
  they said one to another:  'The earth made without inhabitant cries the voice of their
  cryingst up to the gates of heaven. <hi type="super">3</hi> And now to you, the holy ones of heaven, the souls
  of men make their suit, saying, "Bring our cause <hi type="super">4</hi> before the Most High."' And they said
  to the Lord of the ages:  'Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, and God of the ages,
  the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the <hi type="super">5</hi> ages, and Thy name
  holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages!  Thou hast made all things, and power
  over all things hast Thou:  and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest
  all <hi type="super">6</hi> things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee.  Thou seest what Azazel hath done,
  who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were
  (preserved) in heaven, which <hi type="super">7</hi> men were striving to learn:  And Semjaza, to whom Thou
  hast given authority to bear rule over his associates.  And they have gone to the daughters
  of men upon the earth, and have slept with the <hi type="super">9</hi> women, and have defiled themselves, and
  revealed to them all kinds of sins.  And the women have <hi type="super">10</hi> borne giants, and the whole
  earth has thereby been filled with blood and unrighteousness.  And now, behold, the souls
  of those who have died are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their
  lamentations have ascended:  and cannot cease because of the lawless deeds which are
  <hi type="super">11</hi>
  wrought on the earth.  And Thou knowest all things before they come to pass, and Thou
  seest these things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we are to
  do to them in regard to these.'

  
    <title>Chapter 10</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spake, and sent Uriel to the son of
  Lamech, <hi type="super">2</hi> and said to him:  'Go to Noah and tell him in my name "Hide thyself!" and
  reveal to him the end that is approaching:  that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a
  deluge is about to come <hi type="super">3</hi> upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.  And
  now instruct him that he may escape <hi type="super">4</hi> and his seed may be preserved for all the
  generations of the world.'  And again the Lord said to Raphael:  'Bind Azazel hand and
  foot, and cast him into the darkness:  and make an opening <hi type="super">5</hi> in the desert, which is in
  Dudael, and cast him therein.  And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him
  with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may
  <hi type="super">6,7</hi> not see
  light.  And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.  And heal the
  earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may
  heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret
  things that the <hi type="super">8</hi> Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons.  And the whole earth
  has been corrupted <hi type="super">9</hi> through the works that were taught by Azazel:  to him ascribe all
  sin.'  And to Gabriel said the Lord:  'Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and
  against the children of fornication:  and destroy [the children of fornication and] the
  children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]:  send them one
  against the other that they may destroy each other in <hi type="super">10</hi> battle:  for length of days shall
  they not have.  And no request that they (i.e. their fathers) make of thee shall be granted
  unto their fathers on their behalf; for they hope to live an eternal life, and
  <hi type="super">11</hi> that each one
  of them will live five hundred years.'  And the Lord said unto Michael:  'Go, bind Semjaza
  and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled
  themselves <hi type="super">12</hi> with them in all their uncleanness.  And when their sons have slain one
  another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for
  seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their
  consummation, till the judgement that is <hi type="super">13</hi> for ever and ever is consummated.  In those
  days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire:  and <hi type="super">14</hi> to the torment and the prison in
  which they shall be confined for ever.  And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed
  will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all <hi type="super">15</hi> generations.  And
  destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because
  <hi type="super">16</hi> they
  have wronged mankind.  Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil
  work come to an end:  and let the plant of righteousness and truth appear:  and it shall
  prove a blessing; the works of righteousness and truth' shall be planted in truth and joy for
  evermore.

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And in those days I will open the store chambers of blessing which are in the heaven, so
  as to send <hi type="super">2</hi> them down upon the earth over the work and labour of the children of men.
  And truth and peace shall be associated together throughout all the days of the world and
  throughout all the generations of men.'

  
    <title>Chapter 12</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> Before these things Enoch was hidden, and no one of the children of men knew where
  he was <hi type="super">2</hi> hidden, and where he abode, and what had become of him.  And his activities
  had to do with the Watchers, and his days were with the holy ones. <hi type="super">3</hi> And I Enoch was
  blessing the Lord of majesty and the King of the ages, and lo! the Watchers <hi type="super">4</hi> called me -Enoch the scribe- and said to me:  'Enoch, thou scribe of righteousness, go, declare to the
  Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven, the holy eternal place, and have
  defiled themselves with women, and have done as the children of earth do, and have taken
  unto themselves <hi type="super">5</hi> wives:  "Ye have wrought great destruction on the earth:  And ye shall
  have no peace nor forgiveness <hi type="super">6</hi> of sin:  and inasmuch as they delight themselves in their
  children, The murder of their beloved ones shall they see, and over the destruction of their
  children shall they lament, and shall make supplication unto eternity, but mercy and peace
  shall ye not attain."'

  
    <title>Chapter 13</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And Enoch went and said:  'Azazel, thou shalt have no peace:  a severe sentence has
  gone forth <hi type="super">2</hi> against thee to put thee in bonds:  And thou shalt not have toleration nor
  request granted to thee, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and
  because of all the works of godlessness <hi type="super">3</hi> and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast
  shown to men.'  Then I went and spoke to them all <hi type="super">4</hi> together, and they were all afraid,
  and fear and trembling seized them.  And they besought me to draw up a petition for them
  that they might find forgiveness, and to read their petition in the presence <hi type="super">5</hi> of the Lord of
  heaven.  For from thenceforward they could not speak (with Him) nor lift up their
  <hi type="super">6</hi> eyes
  to heaven for shame of their sins for which they had been condemned.  Then I wrote out
  their petition, and the prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds individually and in
  regard to their <hi type="super">7</hi> requests that they should have forgiveness and length.  And I went off
  and sat down at the waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of
  Hermon:  I read their petition till I fell <hi type="super">8</hi> asleep.  And behold a dream came to me, and
  visions fell down upon me, and I saw visions of chastisement, and a voice came bidding
  (me) I to tell it to the sons of heaven, and reprimand them. <hi type="super">9</hi> And when I awaked, I came
  unto them, and they were all sitting gathered together, weeping in <hi type="super">10</hi> 'Abelsjail, which is
  between Lebanon and Seneser, with their faces covered.  And I recounted before them all
  the visions which I had seen in sleep, and I began to speak the words of righteousness, and
  to reprimand the heavenly Watchers.

  
    <title>Chapter 14</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> The book of the words of righteousness, and of the reprimand of the eternal Watchers in
  accordance <hi type="super">2</hi> with the command of the Holy Great One in that vision.  I saw in my sleep
  what I will now say with a tongue of flesh and with the breath of my mouth:  which the
  Great One has given to men to <hi type="super">3</hi> converse therewith and understand with the heart.  As
  He has created and given to man the power of understanding the word of wisdom, so hath
  He created me also and given me the power of reprimanding <hi type="super">4</hi> the Watchers, the children
  of heaven.  I wrote out your petition, and in my vision it appeared thus, that your petition
  will not be granted unto you throughout all the days of eternity, and that judgement
  <hi type="super">5</hi> has
  been finally passed upon you:  yea (your petition) will not be granted unto you.  And from
  henceforth you shall not ascend into heaven unto all eternity, and in bonds of the earth the
  decree <hi type="super">6</hi> has gone forth to bind you for all the days of the world.  And (that) previously
  you shall have seen the destruction of your beloved sons and ye shall have no pleasure in
  them, but they shall fall before <hi type="super">7</hi> you by the sword.  And your petition on their behalf shall
  not be granted, nor yet on your own:  even though you weep and pray and speak all the
  words contained in the writing which I have <hi type="super">8</hi> written.  And the vision was shown to me
  thus:  Behold, in the vision clouds invited me and a mist summoned me, and the course of
  the stars and the lightnings sped and hastened me, and the winds in <hi type="super">9</hi> the vision caused me
  to fly and lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven.  And I went in till I drew nigh to a
  wall which is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire:  and it began to affright
  <hi type="super">10</hi> me.  And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built
  of crystals:  and the walls of the house were like a tesselated floor (made) of crystals, and
  its groundwork was <hi type="super">11</hi> of crystal.  Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the
  lightnings, and between them were <hi type="super">12</hi> fiery cherubim, and their heaven was (clear as)
  water.  A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its <hi type="super">13</hi> portals blazed with fire.  And I
  entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice:  there <hi type="super">14</hi> were no delights of
  life therein:  fear covered me, and trembling got hold upon me.  And as I quaked
  <hi type="super">15</hi> and
  trembled, I fell upon my face.  And I beheld a vision, And lo! there was a second house,
  greater <hi type="super">16</hi> than the former, and the entire portal stood open before me, and it was built of
  flames of fire.  And in every respect it so excelled in splendour and magnificence and
  extent that I cannot describe to <hi type="super">17</hi> you its splendour and its extent.  And its floor was of
  fire, and above it were lightnings and the path <hi type="super">18</hi> of the stars, and its ceiling also was
  flaming fire.  And I looked and saw therein a lofty throne:  its appearance was as crystal,
  and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of <hi type="super">19</hi> cherubim.  And
  from underneath the throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not look
  <hi type="super">20</hi>
  thereon.  And the Great Glory sat thereon, and His raiment shone more brightly than the
  sun and <hi type="super">21</hi> was whiter than any snow.  None of the angels could enter and could behold
  His face by reason <hi type="super">22</hi> of the magnificence and glory and no flesh could behold Him.  The
  flaming fire was round about Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none around
  could draw nigh Him:  ten thousand times <hi type="super">23</hi> ten thousand (stood) before Him, yet He
  needed no counselor.  And the most holy ones who were <hi type="super">24</hi> nigh to Him did not leave by
  night nor depart from Him.  And until then I had been prostrate on my face, trembling:
  and the Lord called me with His own mouth, and said to me:  ' Come hither, <hi type="super">25</hi> Enoch,
  and hear my word.'  And one of the holy ones came to me and waked me, and He made
  me rise up and approach the door:  and I bowed my face downwards.

  
    <title>Chapter 15</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And He answered and said to me, and I heard His voice:  'Fear not, Enoch, thou
  righteous <hi type="super">2</hi> man and scribe of righteousness:  approach hither and hear my voice.  And go,
  say to the Watchers of heaven, who have sent thee to intercede for them:  "You should
  intercede" for men, and not men <hi type="super">3</hi> for you:  Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and
  eternal heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men
  and taken to yourselves wives, and done like the children <hi type="super">4</hi> of earth, and begotten giants
  (as your) sons?  And though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have defiled
  yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh,
  and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those also do who die
  <hi type="super">5</hi>
  and perish.  Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and
  beget <hi type="super">6</hi> children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth.  But you
  were formerly <hi type="super">7</hi> spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of the
  world.  And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of
  the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling. <hi type="super">8</hi> And now, the giants, who are produced from the
  spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon <hi type="super">9</hi> the earth, and on the earth shall be their
  dwelling.  Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men
  and from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; <hi type="super">10</hi> they shall be evil
  spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called.  [As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven
  shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth,
  on the earth shall be their dwelling.]  And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy,
  attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble:  they take no food,
  but nevertheless <hi type="super">12</hi> hunger and thirst, and cause offences.  And these spirits shall rise up
  against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from
  them.

  
    <title>Chapter 16</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> From the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants, from the souls of
  whose flesh the spirits, having gone forth, shall destroy without incurring judgement -thus
  shall they destroy until the day of the consummation, the great judgement in which the age
  shall be <hi type="super">2</hi> consummated, over the Watchers and the godless, yea, shall be wholly
  consummated."  And now as to the watchers who have sent thee to intercede for them,
  who had been aforetime in heaven, (say <hi type="super">3</hi> to them):  "You have been in heaven, but all the
  mysteries had not yet been revealed to you, and you knew worthless ones, and these in the
  hardness of your hearts you have made known to the women, and through these mysteries
  women and men work much evil on earth." <hi type="super">4</hi> Say to them therefore:  " You have no
  peace."'

  
    <title>Chapter 17</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And they took and brought me to a place in which those who were there were like
  flaming fire, <hi type="super">2</hi> and, when they wished, they appeared as men.  And they brought me to the
  place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven.  And I
  saw the places of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars and of the thunder and in
  the uttermost depths, where were <hi type="super">4</hi> a fiery bow and arrows and their quiver, and a fiery
  sword and all the lightnings.  And they took <hi type="super">5</hi> me to the living waters, and to the fire of
  the west, which receives every setting of the sun.  And I came to a river of fire in which
  the fire flows like water and discharges itself into the great sea towards <hi type="super">6</hi> the west.  I saw
  the great rivers and came to the great river and to the great darkness, and went
  <hi type="super">7</hi> to the
  place where no flesh walks.  I saw the mountains of the darkness of winter and the place
  <hi type="super">8</hi>
  whence all the waters of the deep flow.  I saw the mouths of all the rivers of the earth and
  the mouth of the deep.

  
    <title>Chapter 18</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> I saw the treasuries of all the winds:  I saw how He had furnished with them the whole
  creation <hi type="super">2</hi> and the firm foundations of the earth.  And I saw the corner-stone of the earth:
  I saw the four <hi type="super">3</hi> winds which bear [the earth and] the firmament of the heaven.  And I saw
  how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven, and have their station between heaven and
  earth:  these are the pillars <hi type="super">4</hi> of the heaven.  I saw the winds of heaven which turn and
  bring the circumference of the sun and <hi type="super">5</hi> all the stars to their setting.  I saw the winds on
  the earth carrying the clouds:  I saw the paths <hi type="super">6</hi> of the angels.  I saw at the end of the
  earth the firmament of the heaven above.  And I proceeded and saw a place which burns
  day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, <hi type="super">7</hi> three towards the
  east, and three towards the south.  And as for those towards the east, was of
  coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red
  stone. <hi type="super">8</hi> But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and
  the summit of the <hi type="super">9,10</hi> throne was of sapphire.  And I saw a flaming fire.  And beyond
  these mountains Is a region the end of the great earth:  there the heavens were completed.
  And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of
  fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards <hi type="super">12</hi> the height and towards the depth.
  And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no
  firmly founded earth beneath it:  there was no water upon it, and no <hi type="super">13</hi> birds, but it was a
  waste and horrible place.  I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains,
  <hi type="super">14</hi> and to
  me, when I inquired regarding them, The angel said:  'This place is the end of heaven and
  earth:  this has become a prison for the stars and the host of heaven.  And the stars which
  roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in the
  beginning of <hi type="super">16</hi> their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times.  And
  He was wroth with them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be
  consummated (even) for ten thousand years.'

  
    <title>Chapter 19</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And Uriel said to me:  'Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with
  women, and their spirits assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead
  them astray into sacrificing to demons as gods, (here shall they stand,) till the day of the
  great judgement in <hi type="super">2</hi> which they shall be judged till they are made an end of.  And the
  women also of the angels who <hi type="super">3</hi> went astray shall become sirens.'  And I, Enoch, alone
  saw the vision, the ends of all things:  and no man shall see as I have seen.

  
    <title>Chapter 20</title>
  <hi type="super">1,2</hi> And these are the names of the holy angels who watch.  Uriel, one of the holy angels,
  who is <hi type="super">3</hi> over the world and over Tartarus.  Raphael, one of the holy angels, who is over
  the spirits of men. <hi type="super">4,5</hi> Raguel, one of the holy angels who takes vengeance on the world
  of the luminaries.  Michael, one <hi type="super">6</hi> of the holy angels, to wit, he that is set over the best
  part of mankind and over chaos.  Saraqael, <hi type="super">7</hi> one of the holy angels, who is set over the
  spirits, who sin in the spirit.  Gabriel, one of the holy <hi type="super">8</hi> angels, who is over Paradise and
  the serpents and the Cherubim.  Remiel, one of the holy angels, whom God set over those
  who rise.


    <title>Chapter 21</title>
  <hi type="super">1,2</hi> And I proceeded to where things were chaotic.  And I saw there something horrible:  I
  saw neither <hi type="super">3</hi> a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible.
  And there I saw <hi type="super">4</hi> seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and
  burning with fire.  Then <hi type="super">5</hi> I said:  'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have
  they been cast in hither?'  Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and
  was chief over them, and said:  'Enoch, why <hi type="super">6</hi> dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for
  the truth?  These are of the number of the stars of heaven, which have transgressed the
  commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, <hi type="super">7</hi> the time entailed
  by their sins, are consummated.'  And from thence I went to another place, which was still
  more horrible than the former, and I saw a horrible thing:  a great fire there which burnt
  and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending
  columns of <hi type="super">8</hi> fire:  neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.
  Then I said:  'How <hi type="super">9</hi> fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!'  Then Uriel
  answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me:  'Enoch, why
  hast thou such fear and affright?'  And <hi type="super">10</hi> I answered:  'Because of this fearful place, and
  because of the spectacle of the pain.'  And he said unto me:  'This place is the prison of the
  angels, and here they will be imprisoned for ever.'

  
    <title>Chapter 22</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And thence I went to another place, and he mountain [and] of hard rock.
  <hi type="super">2</hi> And there
  was in it four hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth.  How smooth are the hollow
  places and deep and dark to look at. <hi type="super">3</hi> Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels
  who was with me, and said unto me:  'These hollow places have been created for this very
  purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should <hi type="super">4</hi> assemble therein, yea that all the
  souls of the children of men should assemble here.  And these places have been made to
  receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period [till the period
  appointed], till the great judgement (comes) upon them.'  I saw (the spirit of) a dead man
  making suit, <hi type="super">5</hi> and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit.  And I asked Raphael the
  angel who was <hi type="super">6</hi> with me, and I said unto him:  'This spirit which maketh suit, whose is it,
  whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven ?'  7 And he answered me saying:
  'This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes
  his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is
  annihilated from amongst the seed of men.' <hi type="super">8</hi> The I asked regarding it, and regarding all
  the hollow places:  'Why is one separated from the other?' <hi type="super">9</hi> And he answered me and said
  unto me:  'These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be separated.
  And such a division has been make (for) the spirits of the righteous, in which there is the
  bright spring of <hi type="super">10</hi> water.  And such has been made for sinners when they die and are
  buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed on them in their <hi type="super">11</hi> lifetime.
  Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain till the great day of judgement and
  punishment and torment of those who curse for ever and retribution for their spirits.
  There <hi type="super">12</hi> He shall bind them for ever.   And such a division has been made for the spirits
  of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when
  they were slain in the days <hi type="super">13</hi> of the sinners.  Such has been made for the spirits of men
  who were not righteous but sinners, who were complete in transgression, and of the
  transgressors they shall be companions:  but their spirits shall not be slain in the day of
  judgement nor shall they be raised from thence.' <hi type="super">14</hi> The I blessed the Lord of glory and
  said:  'Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness, who ruleth for ever.'

  
    <title>Chapter 23</title>
   <hi type="super">1,2</hi> From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the earth.  And I saw a
  burning <hi type="super">3</hi> fire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night but
  (ran) regularly.  And <hi type="super">4</hi> I asked saying:  'What is this which rests not?'  Then Raguel, one of
  the holy angels who was with me, answered me and said unto me:  'This course of fire
  which thou hast seen is the fire in the west which persecutes all the luminaries of
  heaven.'

  
    <title>Chapter 24</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And from thence I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain
  range of <hi type="super">2</hi> fire which burnt day and night.  And I went beyond it and saw seven
  magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were
  magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior:
  three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon
  the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which <hi type="super">3</hi> joined with any other.  And the
  seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them <hi type="super">4</hi> in height, resembling
  the seat of a throne:  and fragrant trees encircled the throne.  And amongst them was a
  tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it:
  it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for
  ever: <hi type="super">5</hi> and its fruit is beautiful, and its fruit n resembles the dates of a palm.  Then I said:
  'How beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms very
  delightful in appearance.' <hi type="super">6</hi> Then answered Michael, one of the holy and honoured angels
  who was with me, and was their leader.

  
    <title>Chapter 25</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And he said unto me:  'Enoch, why dost thou ask me regarding the fragrance of the tree,
  <hi type="super">2</hi> and why dost thou wish to learn the truth?'  Then I answered him saying:  'I wish to
  <hi type="super">3</hi>
  know about everything, but especially about this tree.'  And he answered saying:  'This
  high mountain which thou hast seen, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His
  throne, where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He
  shall come down to visit <hi type="super">4</hi> the earth with goodness.  And as for this fragrant tree no
  mortal is permitted to touch it till the great judgement, when He shall take vengeance on
  all and bring (everything) to its consummation <hi type="super">5</hi> for ever.  It shall then be given to the
  righteous and holy.  Its fruit shall be for food to the elect:  it shall be transplanted to the
  holy place, to the temple of the Lord, the Eternal King.

  <hi type="super">7</hi>    Then blessed I the God of Glory, the Eternal King, who hath prepared such things for
  the righteous, and hath created them and promised to give to them.

  
    <title>Chapter 26</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a blessed place in which
  there were <hi type="super">2</hi> trees with branches abiding and blooming [of a dismembered tree].  And
  there I saw a holy mountain, <hi type="super">3</hi> and underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream
  and it flowed towards the south.  And I saw towards the east another mountain higher
  than this, and between them a deep and narrow <hi type="super">4</hi> ravine:  in it also ran a stream
  underneath the mountain.  And to the west thereof there was another mountain, lower
  than the former and of small elevation, and a ravine deep and dry between them:  and
  another deep and dry ravine was at the extremities of the three mountains.  And all the
  ravines were deep and narrow, (being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted
  upon <hi type="super">6</hi> them.  And I marveled at the rocks, and I marveled at the ravine, yea, I marveled
  very much.

  
    <title>Chapter 27</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> Then said I:  'For what object is this blessed land, which is entirely filled with trees, and
  this <hi type="super">2</hi> accursed valley between?'  Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who was with me,
  answered and said:  'This accursed valley is for those who are accursed for ever:  Here
  shall all the accursed be gathered together who utter with their lips against the Lord
  unseemly words and of His glory speak hard things.  Here shall they be gathered together,
  and here <hi type="super">3</hi> shall be their place of judgement.  In the last days there shall be upon them the
  spectacle of righteous judgement in the presence of the righteous for ever:  here shall the
  merciful bless the Lord of glory, the Eternal King. <hi type="super">4</hi> In the days of judgement over the
  former, they shall bless Him for the mercy in accordance with <hi type="super">5</hi> which He has assigned
  them (their lot).' Then I blessed the Lord of Glory and set forth His glory and lauded Him
  gloriously.

  
    <title>Chapter 28</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And thence I went towards the east, into the midst of the mountain range of the desert,
  and <hi type="super">2</hi> I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and plants.  And water gushed
  forth from <hi type="super">3</hi> above.  Rushing like a copious watercourse [which flowed] towards the
  north-west it caused clouds and dew to ascend on every side.

  
    <title>Chapter 29</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And thence I went to another place in the desert, and approached to the east of this
  mountain <hi type="super">2</hi> range.  And there I saw aromatic trees exhaling the fragrance of frankincense
  and myrrh, and the trees also were similar to the almond tree.

  
    <title>Chapter 30</title>
  <hi type="super">1,2</hi> And beyond these, I went afar to the east, and I saw another place, a valley (full) of
  water.  And <hi type="super">3</hi> therein there was a tree, the colour (?) of fragrant trees such as the mastic.
  And on the sides of those valleys I saw fragrant cinnamon.  And beyond these I proceeded
  to the east.

  
    <title>Chapter 31</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw other mountains, and amongst them were groves of trees, and there flowed
  forth from <hi type="super">2</hi> them nectar, which is named sarara and galbanum.  And beyond these
  mountains I saw another mountain to the east of the ends of the earth, whereon were aloe-trees, and all the trees were full
  <hi type="super">3</hi> of stacte, being like almond-trees.  And when one burnt
  it, it smelt sweeter than any fragrant odour.

  
    <title>Chapter 32</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after these fragrant odours, as I looked towards the north over the mountains I saw
  seven mountains full of choice nard and fragrant trees and cinnamon and pepper.
  <hi type="super">2</hi> And
  thence I went over the summits of all these mountains, far towards the east of the earth,
  and passed above the Erythraean sea and went far from it, and passed over the angel
  Zotiel.  And I came to the Garden of Righteousness, <hi type="super">3</hi> I and from afar off trees more
  numerous than I these trees and great-two trees there, very great, beautiful, and glorious,
  and magnificent, and the tree of knowledge, whose holy fruit they eat and know great
  wisdom. <hi type="super">4</hi> That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves are like (those of) the Carob
  tree:  and its fruit <hi type="super">5</hi> is like the clusters of the vine, very beautiful:  and the fragrance of the
  tree penetrates afar.  Then <hi type="super">6</hi> I said:  'How beautiful is the tree, and how attractive is its
  look!' Then Raphael the holy angel, who was with me, answered me and said:  'This is the
  tree of wisdom, of which thy father old (in years) and thy aged mother, who were before
  thee, have eaten, and they learnt wisdom and their eyes were opened, and they knew that
  they were naked and they were driven out of the garden.'

  
    <title>Chapter 33</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And from thence I went to the ends of the earth and saw there great beasts, and each
  differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also differing in appearance and beauty and
  voice, the one differing from the other.  And to the east of those beasts I saw the ends of
  the earth whereon the heaven <hi type="super">2</hi> rests, and the portals of the heaven open.  And I saw how
  the stars of heaven come forth, and <hi type="super">3</hi> I counted the portals out of which they proceed, and
  wrote down all their outlets, of each individual star by itself, according to their number
  and their names, their courses and their positions, and their <hi type="super">4</hi> times and their months, as
  Uriel the holy angel who was with me showed me.  He showed all things to me and wrote
  them down for me:  also their names he wrote for me, and their laws and their
  companies.

  
    <title>Chapter 34</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth, and there I saw a
  great and <hi type="super">2</hi> glorious device at the ends of the whole earth.  And here I saw three portals of
  heaven open in the heaven:  through each of them proceed north winds:  when they blow
  there is cold, hail, frost, <hi type="super">3</hi> snow, dew, and rain.  And out of one portal they blow for good:
  but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with violence and affliction on the
  earth, and they blow with violence.

  
    <title>Chapter 35</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And from thence I went towards the west to the ends of the earth, and saw there three
  portals of the heaven open such as I had seen in the east, the same number of portals, and
  the same number of outlets.

  
    <title>Chapter 36</title>
  <hi type="super">1</hi> And from thence I went to the south to the ends of the earth, and saw there three open
  portals <hi type="super">2</hi> of the heaven:  and thence there come dew, rain, and wind.  And from thence I
  went to the east to the ends of the heaven, and saw here the three eastern portals of
  heaven open and small portals <hi type="super">3</hi> above them.  Through each of these small portals pass the
  stars of heaven and run their course to the west on the path which is shown to them.  And
  as often as I saw I blessed always the Lord of Glory, and I continued to bless the Lord of
  Glory who has wrought great and glorious wonders, to show the greatness of His work to
  the angels and to spirits and to men, that they might praise His work and all His creation:
  that they might see the work of His might and praise the great work of His hands and bless
  Him for ever.

  <title>The Parables</title>

  
    <title>Chapter 37</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> The second vision which he saw, the vision of wisdom -which Enoch the son of Jared,
  the son <hi type="super">2</hi> of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of
  Adam, saw.  And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I lifted up my voice
  to speak and say to those which dwell on earth:  Hear, ye men of old time, and see, ye that
  come after, the words of the Holy <hi type="super">3</hi> One which I will speak before the Lord of Spirits.  It
  were better to declare (them only) to the men of old time, but even from those that come
  after we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom. <hi type="super">4</hi> Till the present day such wisdom
  has never been given by the Lord of Spirits as I have received according to my insight,
  according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits by whom the lot of <hi type="super">5</hi> eternal life has
  been given to me.  Now three Parables were imparted to me, and I lifted up my voice and
  recounted them to those that dwell on the earth.

  <hi type="super">1</hi> The first Parable.

       <hi type="super">9</hi>    In those days I praised and extolled the name of the Lord of Spirits with blessings and
  praises, because He hath destined me for blessing and glory according to the good
  pleasure of the Lord of <hi type="super">10</hi> Spirits.  For a long time my eyes regarded that place, and I
  blessed Him and praised Him, saying:  'Blessed is He, and may He be blessed from the
  beginning and for evermore.  And before Him there is no ceasing.  He knows before the
  world was created what is for ever and what will be from <hi type="super">12</hi> generation unto generation.
  Those who sleep not bless Thee:  they stand before Thy glory and bless, praise, and extol,
  saying:  "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Spirits:  He filleth the earth with
       <hi type="super">13</hi> spirits."' And
  here my eyes saw all those who sleep not:  they stand before Him and bless and say:
  'Blessed be Thou, and blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever.'  And my face
  was changed; for I could no longer behold.

  
  <title>Chapter 40</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after that I saw thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, I saw
  a multitude <hi type="super">2</hi> beyond number and reckoning, who stood before the Lord of Spirits.  And
  on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits I saw four presences, different from those that
  sleep not, and I learnt their names:  for the angel that went with me made known to me
  their names, and showed me all the hidden things. <hi type="super">3</hi> And I heard the voices of those four
  presences as they uttered praises before the Lord of glory. <hi type="super">4,5</hi> The first voice blesses the
  Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.  And the second voice I heard blessing <hi type="super">6</hi> the Elect One
  and the elect ones who hang upon the Lord of Spirits.  And the third voice I heard pray
  and intercede for those who dwell on the earth and supplicate in the name of the Lord of
  Spirits. <hi type="super">7</hi> And I heard the fourth voice fending off the Satans and forbidding them to
  come before the Lord <hi type="super">8</hi> of Spirits to accuse them who dwell on the earth.  After that I
  asked the angel of peace who went with me, who showed me everything that is hidden:
  'Who are these four presences which I have <hi type="super">9</hi> seen and whose words I have heard and
  written down?' And he said to me:  'This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering:
  and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men,
  is Raphael:  and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel:  and the fourth, who
  is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.'
  <hi type="super">10</hi> And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those
  days.

  
  <title>Chapter 41</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after that I saw all the secrets of the heavens, and how the kingdom is divided, and
  how the <hi type="super">2</hi> actions of men are weighed in the balance.  And there I saw the mansions of the
  elect and the mansions of the holy, and mine eyes saw there all the sinners being driven
  from thence which deny the name of the Lord of Spirits, and being dragged off:  and they
  could not abide because of the punishment which proceeds from the Lord of Spirits.
  <hi type="super">3</hi>
  And there mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightning and of the thunder, and the secrets of
  the winds, how they are divided to blow over the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and
  dew, and there <hi type="super">4</hi> I saw from whence they proceed in that place and from whence they
  saturate the dusty earth.  And there I saw closed chambers out of which the winds are
  divided, the chamber of the hail and winds, the chamber of the mist, and of the clouds, and
  the cloud thereof hovers over the earth from the <hi type="super">5</hi> beginning of the world.  And I saw the
  chambers of the sun and moon, whence they proceed and whither they come again, and
  their glorious return, and how one is superior to the other, and their stately orbit, and how
  they do not leave their orbit, and they add nothing to their orbit and they take nothing
  from it, and they keep faith with each other, in accordance with the oath by which they
  <hi type="super">6</hi>
  are bound together.  And first the sun goes forth and traverses his path according to the
  commandment <hi type="super">7</hi> of the Lord of Spirits, and mighty is His name for ever and ever.  And
  after that I saw the hidden and the visible path of the moon, and she accomplishes the
  course of her path in that place by day and by night-the one holding a position opposite to
  the other before the Lord of Spirits.

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven, and I saw how He called them all by
  their <hi type="super">2</hi> names and they hearkened unto Him.  And I saw how they are weighed in a
  righteous balance according to their proportions of light:  (I saw) the width of their spaces
  and the day of their appearing, and how their revolution produces lightning:  and (I saw)
  their revolution according to the <hi type="super">3</hi> number of the angels, and (how) they keep faith with
  each other.  And I asked the angel who went <hi type="super">4</hi> with me who showed me what was hidden:
  'What are these?'  And he said to me:  'The Lord of Spirits hath showed thee their
  parabolic meaning (lit.  'their parable'):  these are the names of the holy who dwell on the
  earth and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.'

  <hi type="super">1</hi> [In those days mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightnings, and of the lights, and the
  judgements they execute (lit.  ' their judgement '):  and they lighten for a blessing or a
  curse as the Lord of <hi type="super">2</hi> Spirits willeth.  And there I saw the secrets of the thunder, and how
  when it resounds above in the heaven, the sound thereof is heard, and he caused me to see
  the judgements executed on the earth, whether they be for well-being and blessing, or for
  a curse according to the word of the Lord of Spirits. <hi type="super">3</hi> And after that all the secrets of the
  lights and lightnings were shown to me, and they lighten for blessing and for

  <title>Chapter 60 A Fragment of the Book of Noah</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> In the year 500, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the life of
  Enoch.  In that Parable I saw how a mighty quaking made the heaven of heavens to quake,
  and the host of the Most High, and the angels, a thousand thousands and ten thousand
  times ten thousand, were <hi type="super">2</hi> disquieted with a great disquiet.  And the Head of Days sat on
  the throne of His glory, and the angels and the righteous stood around Him.

  <hi type="super">4</hi> And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up, and
  when he had raised me up my spirit returned; for I had not been able to endure the look of
  this host, and the <hi type="super">5</hi> commotion and the quaking of the heaven.  And Michael said unto me:
  ' Why art thou disquieted with such a vision? Until this day lasted the day of His mercy;
  and He hath been merciful and <hi type="super">6</hi> long-suffering towards those who dwell on the earth.
  And when the day, and the power, and the punishment, and the judgement come, which
  the Lord of Spirits hath prepared for those who worship not the righteous law, and for
  those who deny the righteous judgement, and for those who take His name in vain-that
  day is prepared, for the elect a covenant, but for sinners an inquisition. <hi type="super">25</hi> When the
  punishment of the Lord of Spirits shall rest upon them, it shall rest in order that the
  punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come, in vain, and it shall slay the children with
  their mothers and the children with their fathers.  Afterwards the judgement shall take
  place according to His mercy and His patience.' <hi type="super">7</hi> And on that day were two monsters
  parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the <hi type="super">8</hi>
  abysses of the ocean over the
  fountains of the waters.  But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied with his breast a
  waste wilderness named Duidain, on the east of the garden where the elect and righteous
  dwell, where my grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the first <hi type="super">9</hi> man whom
  the Lord of Spirits created.  And I besought the other angel that he should show me the
  might of those monsters, how they were parted on one day and cast, the one into the
  abysses <hi type="super">10</hi> of the sea, and the other unto the dry land of the wilderness.  And he said to
  me:  ' Thou son of man, herein thou dost seek to know what is hidden.' <hi type="super">11</hi> And the other
  angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden told me what is first and last in
  the heaven in the height, and beneath the earth in the depth, and at the ends of the
  <hi type="super">12</hi>
  heaven, and on the foundation of the heaven.  And the chambers of the winds, and how
  the winds are divided, and how they are weighed, and (how) the portals of the winds are
  reckoned, each according to the power of the wind, and the power of the lights of the
  moon, and according to the power that is fitting:  and the divisions of the stars according
  to their names, and how all the divisions <hi type="super">13</hi> are divided.  And the thunders according to
  the places where they fall, and all the divisions that are made among the lightnings that it
  may lighten, and their host that they may at once obey. <hi type="super">14</hi> For the thunder has places of
  rest (which) are assigned (to it) while it is waiting for its peal; and the thunder and
  lightning are inseparable, and although not one and undivided, they both go together
  <hi type="super">15</hi>
  through the spirit and separate not.  For when the lightning lightens, the thunder utters its
  voice, and the spirit enforces a pause during the peal, and divides equally between them;
  for the treasury of their peals is like the sand, and each one of them as it peals is held in
  with a bridle, and turned back by the power of the spirit, and pushed forward according to
  the many quarters of the earth. <hi type="super">16</hi> And the spirit of the sea is masculine and strong, and
  according to the might of his strength he draws it back with a rein, and in like manner it is
  driven forward and disperses amid all the mountains <hi type="super">17</hi> of the earth.  And the spirit of the
  hoar-frost is his own angel, and the spirit of the hail is a good <hi type="super">18</hi> angel.  And the spirit of
  the snow has forsaken his chambers on account of his strength -There is a special spirit
  therein, and that which ascends from it is like smoke, and its name is frost.  And the spirit
  of the mist is not united with them in their chambers, but it has a special chamber; for its
  course is glorious both in light and in darkness, and in winter and in summer, and in its
  chamber is an angel. <hi type="super">19</hi> And the spirit of the dew has its dwelling at the ends of the
  heaven, and is connected with the chambers of the rain, and its course is in winter and
  summer:  and its clouds and the clouds of the <hi type="super">20</hi> mist are connected, and the one gives to
  the other.  And when the spirit of the rain goes forth from its chamber, the angels come
  and open the chamber and lead it out, and when it is diffused over the whole earth it unites
  with the water on the earth.  And whensoever it unites with the water on <hi type="super">21</hi> the earth .  .  .
  For the waters are for those who dwell on the earth; for they are nourishment for the earth
  from the Most High who is in heaven:  therefore there is a measure for the rain,
  <hi type="super">22</hi>, and
  the angels take it in charge.  And these things I saw towards the Garden of the Righteous.
  <hi type="super">23</hi> And the angel of peace who was with me said to me:  ' These two monsters, prepared
  conformably to the greatness of God, shall feed .  .  .

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw in those days how long cords were given to those angels, and they took to
  themselves wings and flew, and they went towards the north. <hi type="super">2</hi> And I asked the angel,
  saying unto him:  ' Why have those (angels) taken these cords and gone off ? ' And he said
  unto me:  ' They have gone to measure.'

  <hi type="super">12</hi> Thus spake the Lord of Spirits:  ' This is the ordinance and judgement with respect to
  the mighty and the kings and the exalted and those who possess the earth before the Lord
  of Spirits.'

  
  <title>Chapter 64</title>

   <hi type="super">1,2</hi> And other forms I saw hidden in that place.  I heard the voice of the angel saying:  '
  These are the angels who descended to the earth, and revealed what was hidden to the
  children of men and seduced the children of men into committing sin.'

  
  <title>Chapter 65</title>

  <hi type="super">1, 2</hi> And in those days Noah saw the earth that it had sunk down and its destruction was
  nigh.  And he arose from thence and went to the ends of the earth, and cried aloud to his
  grandfather Enoch: <hi type="super">3</hi> and Noah said three times with an embittered voice:  Hear me, hear
  me, hear me.' And I said unto him:  ' Tell me what it is that is falling out on the earth that
  the earth is in such evil plight <hi type="super">4</hi> and shaken, lest perchance I shall perish with it ? ' And
  thereupon there was a great commotion , on the earth, and a voice was heard from
  heaven, and I fell on my face.  And Enoch my grandfather came and stood by me, and said
  unto me:  ' Why hast thou cried unto me with a bitter cry and weeping <hi type="super">6</hi> And a command
  has gone forth from the presence of the Lord concerning those who dwell on the earth that
  their ruin is accomplished because they have learnt all the secrets of the angels, and all the
  violence of the Satans, and all their powers -the most secret ones- and all the power of
  those who practice sorcery, and the power of witchcraft, and the power of those who
  make molten images <hi type="super">7</hi> for the whole earth:  And how silver is produced from the dust of
  the earth, and how soft metal <hi type="super">8</hi> originates in the earth.  For lead and tin are not produced
  from the earth like the first:  it is a fountain <hi type="super">9</hi> that produces them, and an angel stands
  therein, and that angel is pre-eminent.' And after that my grandfather Enoch took hold of
  me by my hand and raised me up, and said unto me:  ' Go, for I have <hi type="super">10</hi> asked the Lord of
  Spirits as touching this commotion on the earth.  And He said unto me:  " Because of their
  unrighteousness their judgement has been determined upon and shall not be withheld by
  Me for ever.  Because of the sorceries which they have searched out and learnt, the earth
  and those <hi type="super">11</hi> who dwell upon it shall be destroyed." And these-they have no place of
  repentance for ever, because they have shown them what was hidden, and they are the
  damned:  but as for thee, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that thou art pure, and
  guiltless of this reproach concerning the secrets.

  <title>Chapter 66</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and let
  loose all the powers of the waters which are beneath in the earth in order to bring
  judgement and destruction <hi type="super">2</hi> on all who [abide and] dwell on the earth.  And the Lord of
  Spirits gave commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not cause
  the waters to rise but should hold them <hi type="super">3</hi> in check; for those angels were over the powers
  of the waters.  And I went away from the presence of Enoch.

  
  <title>Chapter 67</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And in those days the word of God came unto me, and He said unto me:  ' Noah, thy lot
  has come <hi type="super">2</hi> Up before Me, a lot without blame, a lot of love and uprightness.  And now
  the angels are making a wooden (building), and when they have completed that task I will
  place My hand upon it and preserve it, and there shall come forth from it the seed of life,
  and a change shall set in so that the <hi type="super">3</hi> earth will not remain without inhabitant.  And I will
  make fast thy sed before me for ever and ever, and I will spread abroad those who dwell
  with thee:  it shall not be unfruitful on the face of the earth, but it shall be blessed and
  multiply on the earth in the name of the Lord.' <hi type="super">4</hi> And He will imprison those angels, who
  have shown unrighteousness, in that burning valley which my grandfather Enoch had
  formerly shown to me in the west among the mountains of gold <hi type="super">5</hi> and silver and iron and
  soft metal and tin.  And I saw that valley in which there was a great <hi type="super">6</hi> convulsion and a
  convulsion of the waters.  And when all this took place, from that fiery molten metal and
  from the convulsion thereof in that place, there was produced a smell of sulphur, and it
  was connected with those waters, and that valley of the angels who had led astray
  (mankind) burned <hi type="super">7</hi> beneath that land.  And through its valleys proceed streams of fire,
  where these angels are punished who had led astray those who dwell upon the earth.
  <hi type="super">8</hi>
  But those waters shall in those days serve for the kings and the mighty and the exalted,
  and those who dwell on the earth, for the healing of the body, but for the punishment of
  the spirit; now their spirit is full of lust, that they may be punished in their body, for they
  have denied the Lord of Spirits <hi type="super">9</hi> and see their punishment daily, and yet believe not in His
  name.  And in proportion as the burning of their bodies becomes severe, a corresponding
  change shall take place in their spirit for ever and ever; <hi type="super">10</hi> for before the Lord of Spirits
  none shall utter an idle word.  For the judgement shall come upon them, <hi type="super">11</hi> because they
  believe in the lust of their body and deny the Spirit of the Lord.  And those same waters
  will undergo a change in those days; for when those angels are punished in these waters,
  these water-springs shall change their temperature, and when the angels ascend, this water
  of the <hi type="super">12</hi> springs shall change and become cold.  And I heard Michael answering and
  saying:  ' This judgement wherewith the angels are judged is a testimony for the kings and
  the mighty who possess the <hi type="super">13</hi> earth.' Because these waters of judgement minister to the
  healing of the body of the kings and the lust of their body; therefore they will not see and
  will not believe that those waters will change and become a fire which burns for ever.

  
  <title>Chapter 68</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after that my grandfather Enoch gave me the teaching of all the secrets in the book
  in the Parables which had been given to him, and he put them together for me in the words
  of the book <hi type="super">2</hi> of the Parables.  And on that day Michael answered Raphael and said:  ' The
  power of the spirit transports and makes me to tremble because of the severity of the
  judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels:  who can endure the severe
  judgement which has been executed, and before <hi type="super">3</hi> which they melt away ? ' And Michael
  answered again, and said to Raphael:  ' Who is he whose heart is not softened concerning
  it, and whose reins are not troubled by this word of judgement <hi type="super">4</hi> (that) has gone forth
  upon them because of those who have thus led them out ? ' And it came to pass when he
  stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael said thus to Raphael:  ' I will not take their part
  under the eye of the Lord; for the Lord of Spirits has been angry with them because they
  do <hi type="super">5</hi> as if they were the Lord.  Therefore all that is hidden shall come upon them for ever
  and ever; for neither angel nor man shall have his portion (in it), but alone they have
  received their judgement for ever and ever.

  
  <title>Chapter 69</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after this judgement they shall terrify and make them to tremble because they have
  shown this to those who dwell on the earth. <hi type="super">2</hi> And behold the names of those angels [and
  these are their names:  the first of them is Samjaza, the second Artaqifa, and the third
  Armen, the fourth Kokabel, the fifth Turael, the sixth Rumjal, the seventh Danjal, the
  eighth Neqael, the ninth Baraqel, the tenth Azazel, the eleventh Armaros, the twelfth
  Batarjal, the thirteenth Busasejal, the fourteenth Hananel, the fifteenth Turel, and the
  sixteenth Simapesiel, the seventeenth Jetrel, the eighteenth Tumael, the nineteenth Turel,
  <hi type="super">3</hi>
  the twentieth Rumael, the twenty-first Azazel.  And these are the chiefs of their angels and
  their names, and their chief ones over hundreds and over fifties and over tens].
  <hi type="super">4</hi> The name
  of the first Jeqon:  that is, the one who led astray [all] the sons of God, and brought them
  <hi type="super">5</hi> down to the earth, and led them astray through the daughters of men.  And the second
  was named Asbeel:  he imparted to the holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray
  so that they defiled <hi type="super">6</hi> their bodies with the daughters of men.  And the third was named
  Gadreel:  he it is who showed the children of men all the blows of death, and he led astray
  Eve, and showed [the weapons of death to the sons of men] the shield and the coat of
  mail, and the sword for battle, and all the weapons <hi type="super">7</hi> of death to the children of men.  And
  from his hand they have proceeded against those who dwell <hi type="super">8</hi> on the earth from that day
  and for evermore.  And the fourth was named Penemue:  he taught the <hi type="super">9</hi> children of men
  the bitter and the sweet, and he taught them all the secrets of their wisdom.  And he
  instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity
  to <hi type="super">10</hi> eternity and until this day.  For men were not created for such a purpose, to give
  confirmation <hi type="super">11</hi> to their good faith with pen and ink.  For men were created exactly like
  the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which
  destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, but through this their knowledge
  they are perishing, and through this power <hi type="super">12</hi> it is consuming me.  And the fifth was
  named Kasdeja:  this is he who showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of
  spirits and demons, and the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away,
  and [the smitings of the soul] the bites of the serpent, and the smitings <hi type="super">13</hi> which befall
  through the noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Taba'et.  And this is the task of
  Kasbeel, the chief of the oath which he showed to the holy ones when he dwelt high
  <hi type="super">14</hi>
  above in glory, and its name is Biqa.  This (angel) requested Michael to show him the
  hidden name, that he might enunciate it in the oath, so that those might quake before that
  name and oath who revealed all that was in secret to the children of men.  And this is the
  power of this oath, for it is powerful and strong, and he placed this oath Akae in the hand
  of Michael.

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And it came to pass after this that his name during his lifetime was raised aloft to that
  Son of <hi type="super">2</hi> Man and to the Lord of Spirits from amongst those who dwell on the earth.  And
  he was raised aloft <hi type="super">3</hi> on the chariots of the spirit and his name vanished among them.  And
  from that day I was no longer numbered amongst them:  and he set me between the two
  winds, between the North and the <hi type="super">4</hi> West, where the angels took the cords to measure for
  me the place for the elect and righteous.  And there I saw the first fathers and the
  righteous who from the beginning dwell in that place.

          <p>Section III.  Chapters LXXII-LXXXII</p>
  <title>The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries.</title>

  
  <title>Chapter 72</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of each, according
  to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to their names and places of
  origin, and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel, who was with me, who
  is their guide, showed me; and he showed me all their laws exactly as they are, and how it
  is with regard to all the years of the world <hi type="super">2</hi> and unto eternity, till the new creation is
  accomplished which dureth till eternity.  And this is the first law of the luminaries:  the
  luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of the heaven, <hi type="super">3</hi> and its setting in the
  western portals of the heaven.  And I saw six portals in which the sun rises, and six portals
  in which the sun sets and the moon rises and sets in these portals, and the leaders of the
  stars and those whom they lead:  six in the east and six in the west, and all following each
  other <hi type="super">4</hi> in accurately corresponding order:  also many windows to the right and left of
  these portals.  And first there goes forth the great luminary, named the Sun, and his
  circumference is like the <hi type="super">5</hi> circumference of the heaven, and he is quite filled with
  illuminating and heating fire.  The chariot on which he ascends, the wind drives, and the
  sun goes down from the heaven and returns through the north in order to reach the east,
  and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate (lit.  ' that ') portal and <hi type="super">6</hi> shines in the
  face of the heaven.  In this way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which
  <hi type="super">7</hi> is the
  fourth [those six portals in the cast].  And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in
  the first month are twelve window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are
  opened in <hi type="super">8</hi> their season.  When the sun rises in the heaven, he comes forth through that
  fourth portal thirty, <hi type="super">9</hi> mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in
  the west of the heaven.  And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night
  nightly shorter to the thirtieth <hi type="super">10</hi> morning.  On that day the day is longer than the night by
  a ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts.  And the
  sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the
  east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the fifth <hi type="super">12</hi> portal.  And then the day
  becomes longer by two parts and amounts to eleven parts, and the night <hi type="super">13</hi> becomes
  shorter and amounts to seven parts.  And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth
  <hi type="super">14</hi>
  portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign.
  On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double the night,
  and the day <hi type="super">15</hi> becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts.
  And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun returns
  to the east and enters into the <hi type="super">16</hi> sixth portal, and rises from it and sets thirty mornings.
  And when thirty mornings are accomplished, <hi type="super">17</hi> the day decreases by exactly one part, and
  becomes eleven parts, and the night seven.  And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal
  in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for <hi type="super">18</hi> thirty mornings, and
  sets in the west again in the fifth western portal.  On that day the day decreases by two
  parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night to eight parts.  And the sun goes forth from
  that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for
  one- <hi type="super">20</hi> and-thirty mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the west.  On that day the
  day is equalized with the night, [and becomes of equal length], and the night amounts to
  nine parts and the day to <hi type="super">21</hi> nine parts.  And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the
  west, and returns to the east and rises <hi type="super">22</hi> thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the
  west in the third portal.  And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night
  becomes longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the
  night amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight <hi type="super">23</hi> parts.  And the sun rises from
  that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and for
  thirty mornings rises <hi type="super">24</hi> in the second portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the
  second portal in the west of the heaven.  And on that day the night amounts to eleven
  <hi type="super">25</hi>
  parts and the day to seven parts.  And the sun rises on that day from that second portal
  and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first portal for
  one-and-thirty <hi type="super">26</hi> mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of the heaven.  And on
  that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day:  and the night
  amounts exactly to twelve parts and <hi type="super">27</hi> the day to six.  And the sun has (therewith)
  traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of his orbit, and
  enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west <hi type="super">28</hi> opposite to it.  And on that
  night has the night decreased in length by a ninth part, and the night <hi type="super">29</hi> has become eleven
  parts and the day seven parts.  And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal
  in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising
  <hi type="super">30</hi> and
  setting.  And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts
  <hi type="super">31</hi> and the day to eight.  And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the
  west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and
  sets in the west of the heaven. <hi type="super">32</hi> On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine
  parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night <hi type="super">33</hi> is equal to the day and the year is exactly
  as to its days three hundred and sixty-four.  And the length of the day and of the night, and
  the shortness of the day and of the night arise-through the course <hi type="super">34</hi> of the sun these
  distinctions are made (lit.  ' they are separated ').  So it comes that its course becomes
  <hi type="super">35</hi>
  daily longer, and its course nightly shorter.  And this is the law and the course of the sun,
  and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e.  the great luminary which is
  named the sun, for ever and ever.  And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is
  so named according to <hi type="super">37</hi> its appearance, according as the Lord commanded.  As he rises,
  so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is
  sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.

  
  <title>Chapter 73</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after this law I saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is named
  the Moon.  And her circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and her chariot
  in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given to her in (definite) measure.
  And her rising and setting change every month:  and her days are like the days of the sun,
  and when her light is uniform (i.e.  full) it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the
  sun.  And thus she rises.  And her first phase in the east comes forth on the thirtieth
  morning:  and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first phase of
  the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises.  And
  the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty,
  without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, (and) the <hi type="super">6</hi> fourteenth part of
  her light.  And when she receives one-seventh part of the half of her light, her light
  <hi type="super">7</hi>
  amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof.  And she sets with the sun, and when the
  sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of light, and in that
  night in the beginning of her morning [in the commencement of the lunar day] the moon
  sets with the sun, and <hi type="super">8</hi> is invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of
  them.  And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes forth and recedes
  from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she becomes bright in the (remaining)
  thirteen parts.

  
  <title>Chapter 74</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she performs
  her monthly <hi type="super">2</hi> revolution.  And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all,
  showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to
  me, and I wrote down their months <hi type="super">3</hi> as they were, and the appearance of their lights till
  fifteen days were accomplished.  In single seventh parts she accomplishes all her light in
  the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all her <hi type="super">4</hi> darkness in the west.  And in
  certain months she alters her settings, and in certain months she pursues <hi type="super">5</hi> her own
  peculiar course.  In two months the moon sets with the sun:  in those two middle portals
  the <hi type="super">6</hi> third and the fourth.  She goes forth for seven days, and turns about and returns
  again through the portal where the sun rises, and accomplishes all her light:  and she
  recedes from the sun, and in eight <hi type="super">7</hi> days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes
  forth.  And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until
  she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and
  accomplishes all her light:  and she recedes and enters into the <hi type="super">8</hi> first portal in eight days.
  And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the <hi type="super">9,</hi> 10 sun goes
  forth.  Thus I saw their position -how the moons rose and the sun set in those days.  And
  if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days
  which accrue <hi type="super">11</hi> to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days.
  And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days:  in 5 years 6 days every
  year come to 30 days:  and the <hi type="super">12</hi> moon falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30
  days.  And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance
  or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect
  justice in 364 days.  In 3 years there are 1,092 days, and in 5 years 1,820 days, so that in 8
  years there are 2,912 days.  For the moon alone the days amount in 3 years to 1,062 days,
  and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind:  [i.e.  to the sum (of 1,770) there is 5 to be added
  (1,000 and) 62 days.] And in 5 years there are 1,770 days, so that for the moon the days 6
  in 8 years amount to 21,832 days.  [For in 8 years she falls behind to the amount of 80
  days], all the 17 days she falls behind in 8 years are 80.  And the year is accurately
  completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise
  from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets 30 days.

  
  <title>Chapter 75</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And the leaders of the heads of the thousands, who are placed over the whole creation
  and over all the stars, have also to do with the four intercalary days, being inseparable
  from their office, according to the reckoning of the year, and these render service on the
  four days which are not <hi type="super">2</hi> reckoned in the reckoning of the year.  And owing to them men
  go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the world-stations, one in
  the first portal, one in the third portal of the heaven, one in the fourth portal, and one in
  the sixth portal, and the exactness of the year is <hi type="super">3</hi> accomplished through its separate three
  hundred and sixty-four stations.  For the signs and the times and the years and the days the
  angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory hath set for ever over all the luminaries
  of the heaven, in the heaven and in the world, that they should rule on the face of the
  heaven and be seen on the earth, and be leaders for the day and the night, i.e.  the sun,
  moon, and stars, and all the ministering creatures which make their revolution in all the
  chariots <hi type="super">4</hi> of the heaven.  In like manner twelve doors Uriel showed me, open in the
  circumference of the sun's chariot in the heaven, through which the rays of the sun break
  forth:  and from them is warmth <hi type="super">5</hi> diffused over the earth, when they are opened at their
  appointed seasons.  [And for the winds and <hi type="super">6</hi> the spirit of the dew when they are opened,
  standing open in the heavens at the ends.] As for the twelve portals in the heaven, at the
  ends of the earth, out of which go forth the sun, moon, and stars, <hi type="super">7</hi> and all the works of
  heaven in the east and in the west, There are many windows open to the left and right of
  them, and one window at its (appointed) season produces warmth, corresponding (as
  these do) to those doors from which the stars come forth according as He has commanded
  them, <hi type="super">8</hi> and wherein they set corresponding to their number.  And I saw chariots in the
  heaven, running <hi type="super">9</hi> in the world, above those portals in which revolve the stars that never
  set.  And one is larger than all the rest, and it is that that makes its course through the
  entire world.

  
  <title>Chapter 76</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters (of the
  heaven), from <hi type="super">2</hi> which the winds go forth and blow over the earth.  Three of them are
  open on the face (i.e.  the east) of the heavens, and three in the west, and three on the
  right (i.e.  the south) of the heaven, and <hi type="super">3</hi> three on the left (i.e.  the north).  And the three
  first are those of the east, and three are of the <hi type="super">4</hi> north, and three [after those on the left] of
  the south, and three of the west.  Through four of these come winds of blessing and
  prosperity, and from those eight come hurtful winds:  when they are sent, they bring
  destruction on all the earth and on the water upon it, and on all who dwell thereon, and on
  everything which is in the water and on the land. <hi type="super">5</hi>
  And the first wind from those portals,
  called the east wind, comes forth through the first portal which is in the east, inclining
  towards the south:  from it come forth desolation, drought, heat, <hi type="super">6</hi> and destruction.  And
  through the second portal in the middle comes what is fitting, and from it there come rain
  and fruitfulness and prosperity and dew; and through the third portal which lies toward the
  north come cold and drought. <hi type="super">7</hi> And after these come forth the south winds through three
  portals:  through the first portal of <hi type="super">8</hi> them inclining to the east comes forth a hot wind.
  And through the middle portal next to it there <hi type="super">9</hi> come forth fragrant smells, and dew and
  rain, and prosperity and health.  And through the third portal lying to the west come forth
  dew and rain, locusts and desolation. <hi type="super">10</hi> And after these the north winds:  from the
  seventh portal in the east come dew and rain, locusts and desolation.  And from the middle
  portal come in a direct direction health and rain and dew and prosperity; and through the
  third portal in the west come cloud and hoar-frost, and snow and rain, and dew and
  locusts. <hi type="super">12</hi> And after these [four] are the west winds:  through the first portal adjoining
  the north come forth dew and hoar-frost, and cold and snow and frost.  And from the
  middle portal come forth dew and rain, and prosperity and blessing; and through the last
  portal which adjoins the south come forth drought and desolation, and burning and
  destruction.  And the twelve portals of the four quarters of the heaven are therewith
  completed, and all their laws and all their plagues and all their benefactions have I shown
  to thee, my son Methuselah.

  
  <title>Chapter 77</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And the first quarter is called the east, because it is the first:  and the second, the south,
  because the Most High will descend there, yea, there in quite a special sense will He who
  is blessed for ever <hi type="super">2</hi> descend.  And the west quarter is named the diminished, because
  there all the luminaries of the <hi type="super">3</hi> heaven wane and go down.  And the fourth quarter, named
  the north, is divided into three parts: the first of them is for the dwelling of men:  and the
  second contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests and rivers, and darkness and
  clouds; and the third part contains the garden of righteousness. <hi type="super">4</hi> I saw seven high
  mountains, higher than all the mountains which are on the earth:  and thence <hi type="super">5</hi> comes forth
  hoar-frost, and days, seasons, and years pass away.  I saw seven rivers on the earth larger
  than all the rivers:  one of them coming from the west pours its waters into the Great Sea.
  <hi type="super">6</hi> And these two come from the north to the sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean
  Sea in the <hi type="super">7</hi> east.  And the remaining, four come forth on the side of the north to their own
  sea, two of them to the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea and discharge
  themselves there [and some say: <hi type="super">8</hi> into the desert].  Seven great islands I saw in the sea
  and in the mainland:  two in the mainland and five in the Great Sea.

  
  <title>Chapter 78</title>

  <hi type="super">1, 2</hi> And the names of the sun are the following:  the first Orjares, and the second Tomas.
  And the moon has four names:  the first name is Asonja, the second Ebla, the third
  Benase, and the fourth <hi type="super">3</hi> Erae.  These are the two great luminaries:  their circumference is
  like the circumference of the <hi type="super">4</hi> heaven, and the size of the circumference of both is alike.
  In the circumference of the sun there are seven portions of light which are added to it
  more than to the moon, and in definite measures it is s transferred till the seventh portion
  of the sun is exhausted.  And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their
  revolution by the north, and come forth through the eastern portals <hi type="super">6</hi> on the face of the
  heaven.  And when the moon rises one-fourteenth part appears in the heaven: <hi type="super">7</hi> [the light
  becomes full in her]:  on the fourteenth day she accomplishes her light.  And fifteen parts
  of light are transferred to her till the fifteenth day (when) her light is accomplished,
  according to the sign of the year, and she becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by
  (the addition of) fourteenth <hi type="super">8</hi> parts.  And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first
  day to fourteen parts of her light, on the second to thirteen parts of light, on the third to
  twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on the fifth to ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to
  eight, on the eighth to seven, on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to
  four, on the twelfth to three, on the thirteenth to two, on the <hi type="super">9</hi> fourteenth to the half of a
  seventh, and all her remaining light disappears wholly on the fifteenth.  And <hi type="super">10</hi> in certain
  months the month has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight.  And Uriel showed me
  another law:  when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is transferred to
  her by the sun.  During all the period during which the moon is growing in her light, she is
  transferring it to herself when opposite to the sun during fourteen days [her light is
  accomplished in the heaven, <hi type="super">12</hi> and when she is illumined throughout, her light is
  accomplished full in the heaven.  And on the first <hi type="super">13</hi> day she is called the new moon, for
  on that day the light rises upon her.  She becomes full moon exactly on  the day when the
  sun sets in the west, and from the east she rises at night, and the moon shines the whole
  night through till the sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over against the sun.
  On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes till all the
  light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end, and her circumference is empty,
  void of 5 light.  And three months she makes of thirty days, and at her time she makes
  three months of twenty- nine days each, in which she accomplishes her waning in the first
  period of time, and in the first 6 portal for one hundred and seventy-seven days.  And in
  the time of her going out she appears for three months (of) thirty days each, and for three
  months she appears (of) twenty-nine each.  At night she appears like a man for twenty
  days each time, and by day she appears like the heaven, and there is nothing else in her
  save her light.

  
  <title>Chapter 79</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And now, my son, I have shown thee everything, and the law of all the stars of the
  heaven is <hi type="super">2</hi> completed.  And he showed me all the laws of these for every day, and for
  every season of bearing rule, and for every year, and for its going forth, and for the order
  prescribed to it every month <hi type="super">3</hi> and every week:  And the waning of the moon which takes
  place in the sixth portal:  for in this <hi type="super">4</hi> sixth portal her light is accomplished, and after that
  there is the beginning of the waning: (And the waning) which takes place in the first portal
  in its season, till one hundred and seventy-seven <hi type="super">5</hi> days are accomplished:  reckoned
  according to weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days.  She falls behind the sun and the
  order of the stars exactly five days in the course of one period, and when <hi type="super">6</hi> this place
  which thou seest has been traversed.  Such is the picture and sketch of every luminary
  which Uriel the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me.

  
  <title>Chapter 80</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And in those days the angel Uriel answered and said to me:  ' Behold, I have shown thee
  everything, Enoch, and I have revealed everything to thee that thou shouldst see this sun
  and this moon, and the leaders of the stars of the heaven and all those who turn them, their
  tasks and times and departures.

  <hi type="super">4</hi> Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those who walk In the way of righteousness
  and sin not as the sinners, in the reckoning of all their days in which the sun traverses the
  heaven, entering into and departing from the portals for thirty days with the heads of
  thousands of the order of the stars, together with the four which are intercalated which
  divide the four portions of the year, which <hi type="super">5</hi> lead them and enter with them four days.
  Owing to them men shall be at fault and not reckon them in the whole reckoning of the
  year:  yea, men shall be at fault, and not recognize them <hi type="super">6</hi>
  accurately.  For they belong to
  the reckoning of the year and are truly recorded (thereon) for ever, one in the first portal
  and one in the third, and one in the fourth and one in the sixth, and the year is completed
  in three hundred and sixty-four days. <hi type="super">7</hi> And the account thereof is accurate and the
  recorded reckoning thereof exact; for the luminaries, and months and festivals, and years
  and days, has Uriel shown and revealed to me, to whom the <hi type="super">8</hi> Lord of the whole creation
  of the world hath subjected the host of heaven.  And he has power over night and day in
  the heaven to cause the light to give light to men -sun, moon, and stars, <hi type="super">9</hi> and all the
  powers of the heaven which revolve in their circular chariots.  And these are the orders of
  the stars, which set in their places, and in their seasons and festivals and months.
  <hi type="super">10</hi> And
  these are the names of those who lead them, who watch that they enter at their times, in
  their orders, in their seasons, in their months, in their periods of dominion, and in their
  positions.  Their four leaders who divide the four parts of the year enter first; and after
  them the twelve leaders of the orders who divide the months; and for the three hundred
  and sixty (days) there are heads over thousands who divide the days; and for the four
  intercalary days there are the leaders which sunder <hi type="super">12</hi> the four parts of the year.  And
  these heads over thousands are intercalated between <hi type="super">13</hi> leader and leader, each behind a
  station, but their leaders make the division.  And these are the names of the leaders who
  divide the four parts of the year which are ordained: Milki'el, Hel'emmelek, and
  Mel'ejal,
  <hi type="super">14</hi> and Narel.  And the names of those who lead them: Adnar'el, and
  Ijasusa'el, and 'Elome'el- these three follow the leaders of the orders, and there is one that follows the
  three leaders of the orders which follow those leaders of stations that divide the four parts
  of the year.  In the beginning of the year Melkejal rises first and rules, who is named
  Tam'aini and sun, and <hi type="super">16</hi> all the days of his dominion whilst he bears rule are ninety-one
  days.  And these are the signs of the days which are to be seen on earth in the days of his
  dominion:  sweat, and heat, and calms; and all the trees bear fruit, and leaves are produced
  on all the trees, and the harvest of wheat, and the rose-flowers, and all the flowers which
  come forth in the field, but the trees of the winter season become withered.  And these are
  the names of the leaders which are under them: Berka'el, Zelebs'el, and another who is
  added a head of a thousand, called Hilujaseph:  and the days of the dominion of this
  (leader) are at an end. <hi type="super">18</hi> The next leader after him is
  Hel'emmelek, whom one names the
  shining sun, and all the days <hi type="super">19</hi> of his light are ninety-one days.  And these are the signs of
  (his) days on the earth:  glowing heat and dryness, and the trees ripen their fruits and
  produce all their fruits ripe and ready, and the sheep pair and become pregnant, and all the
  fruits of the earth are gathered in, and everything that is <hi type="super">20</hi> in the fields, and the
  winepress:  these things take place in the days of his dominion.  These are the names, and
  the orders, and the leaders of those heads of thousands: Gida'ljal, Ke'el, and
  He'el, and the
  name of the head of a thousand which is added to them, Asfa'el:  and the days of his
  dominion are at an end.



    <p>Section IV.  Chapters LXXXIII-XC.</p>
  <title>The Dream-Visions.</title>

  
<title>Chapter 83</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And now, my son Methuselah, I will show thee all my visions which I have seen,
  recounting <hi type="super">2</hi> them before thee.  Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one was
  quite unlike the other:  the first when I was learning to write:  the second before I took thy
  mother, (when) I saw a terrible  3 vision.  And regarding them I prayed to the Lord.  I had
  laid me down in the house of my grandfather Mahalalel, (when) I saw in a vision how the
  heaven collapsed and was borne off and fell to <hi type="super">4</hi> the earth.  And when it fell to the earth I
  saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on
  mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent <hi type="super">5</hi> from their stems, and
  hurled down and sunk in the abyss.  And thereupon a word fell into my mouth, <hi type="super">6</hi> and I
  lifted up (my voice) to cry aloud, and said:  ' The earth is destroyed.' And my grandfather
  Mahalalel waked me as I lay near him, and said unto me:  ' Why dost thou cry so, my son,
  and why <hi type="super">7</hi> dost thou make such lamentation?' And I recounted to him the whole vision
  which I had seen, and he said unto me:  ' A terrible thing hast thou seen, my son, and of
  grave moment is thy dream- vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the earth:  it must sink
  into the abyss and be destroyed with <hi type="super">8</hi> a great destruction.  And now, my son, arise and
  make petition to the Lord of glory, since thou art a believer, that a remnant may remain on
  the earth, and that He may not destroy the whole <hi type="super">9</hi> earth.  My son, from heaven all this
  will come upon the earth, and upon the earth there will be great <hi type="super">10</hi> destruction.  After that
  I arose and prayed and implored and besought, and wrote down my prayer for the
  generations of the world, and I will show everything to thee, my son Methuselah.  And
  when I had gone forth below and seen the heaven, and the sun rising in the east, and the
  moon setting in the west, and a few stars, and the whole earth, and everything as He had
  known it in the beginning, then I blessed the Lord of judgement and extolled Him because
  He had made the sun to go forth from the windows of the east, and he ascended and rose
  on the face of the heaven, and set out and kept traversing the path shown unto him.

  
  <title>Chapter 84</title>

  <title>Chapter 85</title>

  <hi type="super">1,2</hi> And after this I saw another dream, and I will show the whole dream to thee, my son.
  And Enoch lifted up (his voice) and spake to his son Methuselah:  ' To thee, my son, will I
  speak:  hear my words-incline thine ear to the dream-vision of thy father.  Before I took
  thy mother Edna, I saw in a vision on my bed, and behold a bull came forth from the earth,
  and that bull was white; and after it came forth a heifer, and along with this (latter) came
  forth two bulls, one of them black and <hi type="super">4</hi> the other red.  And that black bull gored the red
  one and pursued him over the earth, and thereupon <hi type="super">5</hi> I could no longer see that red bull.
  But that black bull grew and that heifer went with him, and <hi type="super">6</hi> I saw that many oxen
  proceeded from him which resembled and followed him.  And that cow, that first one,
  went from the presence of that first bull in order to seek that red one, but found him
  <hi type="super">7</hi> not,
  and lamented with a great lamentation over him and sought him.  And I looked till that
  first <hi type="super">8</hi> bull came to her and quieted her, and from that time onward she cried no more.
  And after that she bore another white bull, and after him she bore many bulls and black
  cows. <hi type="super">9</hi> And I saw in my sleep that white bull likewise grow and become a great white
  bull, and from Him proceeded many white bulls, and they resembled him.  And they began
  to beget many white bulls, which resembled them, one following the other, (even)
  many.

  
  <title>Chapter 86</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And again I saw with mine eyes as I slept, and I saw the heaven above, and behold a star
  fell <hi type="super">2</hi> from heaven, and it arose and eat and pastured amongst those oxen.  And after that I
  saw the large and the black oxen, and behold they all changed their stalls and pastures and
  their cattle, and began <hi type="super">3</hi> to live with each other.  And again I saw in the vision, and looked
  towards the heaven, and behold I saw many stars descend and cast themselves down from
  heaven to that first star, and they became <hi type="super">4</hi> bulls amongst those cattle and pastured with
  them [amongst them].  And I looked at them and saw, and behold they all let out their
  privy members, like horses, and began to cover the cows of the oxen, <hi type="super">5</hi> and they all
  became pregnant and bare elephants, camels, and asses.  And all the oxen feared them and
  were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with
  their <hi type="super">6</hi> horns.  And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the
  children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them.

  
  <title>Chapter 87</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And again I saw how they began to gore each other and to devour each other, and the
  earth <hi type="super">2</hi> began to cry aloud.  And I raised mine eyes again to heaven, and I saw in the
  vision, and behold there came forth from heaven beings who were like white men:  and
  four went forth from that place <hi type="super">3</hi> and three with them.  And those three that had last come
  forth grasped me by my hand and took me up, away from the generations of the earth, and
  raised me up to a lofty place, and showed me <hi type="super">4</hi> a tower raised high above the earth, and all
  the hills were lower.  And one said unto me:  ' Remain here till thou seest everything that
  befalls those elephants, camels, and asses, and the stars and the oxen, and all of them.'

  
  <title>Chapter 88</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw one of those four who had come forth first, and he seized that first star which
  had fallen from the heaven, and bound it hand and foot and cast it into an abyss:  now that
  abyss was <hi type="super">2</hi> narrow and deep, and horrible and dark.  And one of them drew a sword, and
  gave it to those elephants and camels and asses:  then they began to smite each other, and
  the whole earth quaked <hi type="super">3</hi> because of them.  And as I was beholding in the vision, lo, one
  of those four who had come forth stoned (them) from heaven, and gathered and took all
  the great stars whose privy members were like those of horses, and bound them all hand
  and foot, and cast them in an abyss of the earth.

  
  <title>Chapter 89</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And one of those four went to that white bull and instructed him in a secret, without his
  being terrified:  he was born a bull and became a man, and built for himself a great vessel
  and dwelt thereon; <hi type="super">2</hi> and three bulls dwelt with him in that vessel and they were covered
  in.  And again I raised mine eyes towards heaven and saw a lofty roof, with seven water
  torrents thereon, and those torrents <hi type="super">3</hi> flowed with much water into an enclosure.  And I
  saw again, and behold fountains were opened on the surface of that great enclosure, and
  that water began to swell and rise upon the surface, <hi type="super">4</hi> and I saw that enclosure till all its
  surface was covered with water.  And the water, the darkness, and mist increased upon it;
  and as I looked at the height of that water, that water had risen above the height of that
  enclosure, and was streaming over that enclosure, and it stood upon the earth.
  <hi type="super">5</hi> And all
  the cattle of that enclosure were gathered together until I saw how they sank and were
  <hi type="super">6</hi>
  swallowed up and perished in that water.  But that vessel floated on the water, while all
  the oxen and elephants and camels and asses sank to the bottom with all the animals, so
  that I could no longer see them, and they were not able to escape, (but) perished and sank
  into the depths.  And again I saw in the vision till those water torrents were removed from
  that high roof, and the chasms <hi type="super">8</hi> of the earth were leveled up and other abysses were
  opened.  Then the water began to run down into these, till the earth became visible; but
  that vessel settled on the earth, and the darkness <hi type="super">9</hi> retired and light appeared.  But that
  white bull which had become a man came out of that vessel, and the three bulls with him,
  and one of those three was white like that bull, and one of them was red as blood, and one
  black:  and that white bull departed from them. <hi type="super">10</hi> And they began to bring forth beasts of
  the field and birds, so that there arose different genera:  lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas,
  wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens; and among
  them was born a white bull.  And they began to bite one another; but that white bull which
  was born amongst them begat a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the <hi type="super">12</hi> wild asses
  multiplied.  But that bull which was born from him begat a black wild boar and a white
  <hi type="super">13</hi>
  sheep; and the former begat many boars, but that sheep begat twelve sheep.  And when
  those twelve sheep had grown, they gave up one of them to the asses, and those asses
  again gave up that sheep to the wolves, and that sheep grew up among the wolves.  And
  the Lord brought the eleven sheep to live with it and to pasture with it among the wolves:
  and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep.  And the wolves began to fear them,
  and they oppressed them until they destroyed their little ones, and they cast their young
  into a river of much water:  but those sheep began to <hi type="super">16</hi> cry aloud on account of their little
  ones, and to complain unto their Lord.  And a sheep which had been saved from the
  wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses; and I saw the sheep how they lamented and
  cried, and besought their Lord with all their might, till that Lord of the sheep descended at
  the voice of the sheep from a lofty abode, and came to them and pastured them.  And He
  called that sheep which had escaped the wolves, and spake with it concerning the wolves
  that it should <hi type="super">18</hi> admonish them not to touch the sheep.  And the sheep went to the
  wolves according to the word of the Lord, and another sheep met it and went with it, and
  the two went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves, and spake with them
  and admonished them not to touch the <hi type="super">19</hi> sheep from henceforth.  And thereupon I saw
  the wolves, and how they oppressed the sheep <hi type="super">20</hi> exceedingly with all their power; and the
  sheep cried aloud.  And the Lord came to the sheep and they began to smite those wolves:
  and the wolves began to make lamentation; but the sheep became <hi type="super">21</hi> quiet and forthwith
  ceased to cry out.  And I saw the sheep till they departed from amongst the wolves; but
  the eyes of the wolves were blinded, and those wolves departed in pursuit of the sheep
  <hi type="super">22</hi>
  with all their power.  And the Lord of the sheep went with them, as their leader, and all
  His sheep <hi type="super">23</hi> followed Him:  and his face was dazzling and glorious and terrible to behold.
  But the wolves <hi type="super">24</hi> began to pursue those sheep till they reached a sea of water.  And that
  sea was divided, and the water stood on this side and on that before their face, and their
  Lord led them and placed Himself between <hi type="super">25</hi> them and the wolves.  And as those wolves
  did not yet see the sheep, they proceeded into the midst of that sea, and the wolves
  followed the sheep, and [those wolves] ran after them into that sea. <hi type="super">26</hi> And when they
  saw the Lord of the sheep, they turned to flee before His face, but that sea gathered itself
  together, and became as it had been created, and the water swelled and rose till it covered
  <hi type="super">27</hi> those wolves.  And I saw till all the wolves who pursued those sheep perished and were
  drowned. <hi type="super">28</hi> But the sheep escaped from that water and went forth into a wilderness,
  where there was no water and no grass; and they began to open their eyes and to see; and
  I saw the Lord of the sheep <hi type="super">29</hi> pasturing them and giving them water and grass, and that
  sheep going and leading them.  And that <hi type="super">30</hi> sheep ascended to the summit of that lofty
  rock, and the Lord of the sheep sent it to them.  And after that I saw the Lord of the sheep
  who stood before them, and His appearance was great and <hi type="super">31</hi> terrible and majestic, and all
  those sheep saw Him and were afraid before His face.  And they all feared and trembled
  because of Him, and they cried to that sheep with them [which was amongst <hi type="super">32</hi> them]:  '
  We are not able to stand before our Lord or to behold Him.' And that sheep which led
  them again ascended to the summit of that rock, but the sheep began to be blinded and to
  wander <hi type="super">33</hi> from the way which he had showed them, but that sheep wot not thereof.  And
  the Lord of the sheep was wrathful exceedingly against them, and that sheep discovered it,
  and went down from the summit of the rock, and came to the sheep, and found the
  greatest part of them blinded and fallen <hi type="super">34</hi> away.  And when they saw it they feared and
  trembled at its presence, and desired to return to their <hi type="super">35</hi> folds.  And that sheep took other
  sheep with it, and came to those sheep which had fallen away, and began to slay them; and
  the sheep feared its presence, and thus that sheep brought back those <hi type="super">36</hi> sheep that had
  fallen away, and they returned to their folds.  And I saw in this vision till that sheep
  became a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and placed all the sheep in that
  house. <hi type="super">37</hi> And I saw till this sheep which had met that sheep which led them fell asleep:
  and I saw till all the great sheep perished and little ones arose in their place, and they came
  to a pasture, and <hi type="super">38</hi> approached a stream of water.  Then that sheep, their leader which
  had become a man, withdrew <hi type="super">39</hi> from them and fell asleep, and all the sheep sought it and
  cried over it with a great crying.  And I saw till they left off crying for that sheep and
  crossed that stream of water, and there arose the two sheep as leaders in the place of those
  which had led them and fallen asleep (lit.  ' had fallen asleep and led <hi type="super">40</hi> them ').  And I saw
  till the sheep came to a goodly place, and a pleasant and glorious land, and I saw till those
  sheep were satisfied; and that house stood amongst them in the pleasant land. <hi type="super">41</hi> And
  sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes blinded, till another sheep arose and led
  them and brought them all back, and their eyes were opened. <hi type="super">42</hi> And the dogs and the
  foxes and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up
  [another sheep] a ram from their <hi type="super">43</hi> midst, which led them.  And that ram began to butt on
  either side those dogs, foxes, and wild <hi type="super">44</hi> boars till he had destroyed them all.  And that
  sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it forsook
  its glory and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself
  <hi type="super">45</hi>
  unseemly.  And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being
  a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that <hi type="super">46</hi> ram which had forsaken its glory.  And it
  went to it and spake to it alone, and raised it to being a ram, and made it the prince and
  leader of the sheep; but during all these things those dogs <hi type="super">47</hi> oppressed the sheep.  And
  the first ram pursued that second ram, and that second ram arose and fled before it; and I
  saw till those dogs pulled <hi type="super">48</hi> down the first ram.  And that second ram arose
  <hi type="super">49</hi> and led
  the [little] sheep.  And those sheep grew and multiplied; but all the dogs, and foxes, and
  wild boars feared and fled before it, and that ram butted and killed the wild beasts, and
  those wild beasts had no longer any power among the <hi type="super">48b</hi> sheep and robbed them no
  more of ought.  And that ram begat many sheep and fell asleep; and a little sheep became
  ram in its stead, and became prince and leader of those sheep. <hi type="super">50</hi> And that house became
  great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower lofty and great was built
  on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was
  elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full
  table before Him. <hi type="super">51</hi> And again I saw those sheep that they again erred and went many
  ways, and forsook that their house, and the Lord of the sheep called some from amongst
  the sheep and sent them to the sheep, <hi type="super">52</hi> but the sheep began to slay them.  And one of
  them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and cried aloud over the sheep; and
  they sought to slay it, but the Lord of the sheep saved it from <hi type="super">53</hi> the sheep, and brought it
  up to me, and caused it to dwell there.  And many other sheep He sent to those sheep to
  testify unto them and lament over them.  And after that I saw that when they forsook the
  house of the Lord and His tower they fell away entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I
  saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds
  until <hi type="super">55</hi> those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place.  And He gave them
  over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the
  foxes, and to all the wild <hi type="super">56</hi> beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those
  sheep.  And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into
  the hand of the lions, to tear and devour them, <hi type="super">57</hi> into the hand of all the wild beasts.  And
  I began to cry aloud with all my power, and to appeal to the Lord of the sheep, and to
  represent to Him in regard to the sheep that they were devoured <hi type="super">58</hi> by all the wild beasts.
  But He remained unmoved, though He saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and
  swallowed and robbed, and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts.
  <hi type="super">59</hi> And
  He called seventy shepherds, and cast those sheep to them that they might pasture them,
  and He spake to the shepherds and their companions:  ' Let each individual of you pasture
  the sheep <hi type="super">60</hi> henceforward, and everything that I shall command you that do ye.  And I
  will deliver them over unto you duly numbered, and tell you which of them are to be
  destroyed-and them destroy ye.' And <hi type="super">61</hi> He gave over unto them those sheep.  And He
  called another and spake unto him:  ' Observe and mark everything that the shepherds will
  do to those sheep; for they will destroy more of them than <hi type="super">62</hi> I have commanded them.
  And every excess and the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds,
  record (namely) how many they destroy according to my command, and how many
  according to their own caprice:  record against every individual shepherd all the
  destruction he <hi type="super">63</hi> effects.  And read out before me by number how many they destroy, and
  how many they deliver over for destruction, that I may have this as a testimony against
  them, and know every deed of the shepherds, that I may comprehend and see what they
  do, whether or not they abide by my <hi type="super">64</hi> command which I have commanded them.  But
  they shall not know it, and thou shalt not declare it to them, nor admonish them, but only
  record against each individual all the destruction which <hi type="super">65</hi> the shepherds effect each in his
  time and lay it all before me.' And I saw till those shepherds pastured in their season, and
  they began to slay and to destroy more than they were bidden, and they delivered
  <hi type="super">66</hi> those
  sheep into the hand of the lions.  And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater
  part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and
  demolished <hi type="super">67</hi> that house.  And I became exceedingly sorrowful over that tower because
  that house of the sheep was demolished, and afterwards I was unable to see if those sheep
  entered that house. <hi type="super">68</hi> And the shepherds and their associates delivered over those sheep
  to all the wild beasts, to devour them, and each one of them received in his time a definite
  number:  it was written by the other <hi type="super">69</hi> in a book how many each one of them destroyed
  of them.  And each one slew and destroyed many <hi type="super">70</hi> more than was prescribed; and I
  began to weep and lament on account of those sheep.  And thus in the vision I saw that
  one who wrote, how he wrote down every one that was destroyed by those shepherds,
  day by day, and carried up and laid down and showed actually the whole book to the Lord
  of the sheep-(even) everything that they had done, and all that each one of them had made
  <hi type="super">71</hi> away with, and all that they had given over to destruction.  And the book was read
  before the Lord of the sheep, and He took the book from his hand and read it and sealed it
  and laid it down. <hi type="super">72</hi> And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours,
  and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and began to build up
  all that had fallen down of that <hi type="super">73</hi> house; but the wild boars tried to hinder them, but they
  were not able.  And they began again to build as before, and they reared up that tower,
  and it was named the high tower; and they began again to place a table before the tower,
  but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure. <hi type="super">74</hi> And as touching all this the eyes of
  those sheep were blinded so that they saw not, and (the eyes of) their shepherds likewise;
  and they delivered them in large numbers to their shepherds for <hi type="super">75</hi> destruction, and they
  trampled the sheep with their feet and devoured them.  And the Lord of the sheep
  remained unmoved till all the sheep were dispersed over the field and mingled with them
  (i.e.  the <hi type="super">76</hi> beasts), and they (i.e.  the shepherds) did not save them out of the hand of the
  beasts.  And this one who wrote the book carried it up, and showed it and read it before
  the Lord of the sheep, and implored Him on their account, and besought Him on their
  account as he showed Him all the doings <hi type="super">77</hi> of the shepherds, and gave testimony before
  Him against all the shepherds.  And he took the actual book and laid it down beside Him
  and departed.

  
  <title>Chapter 90</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw till that in this manner thirty-five shepherds undertook the pasturing (of the
  sheep), and they severally completed their periods as did the first; and others received
  them into their <hi type="super">2</hi> hands, to pasture them for their period, each shepherd in his own period.
  And after that I saw in my vision all the birds of heaven coming, the eagles, the vultures,
  the kites, the ravens; but the eagles led all the birds; and they began to devour those sheep,
  and to pick out their eyes and to <hi type="super">3</hi> devour their flesh.  And the sheep cried out because
  their flesh was being devoured by the birds, <hi type="super">4</hi> and as for me I looked and lamented in my
  sleep over that shepherd who pastured the sheep.  And I saw until those sheep were
  devoured by the dogs and eagles and kites, and they left neither flesh nor skin nor sinew
  remaining on them till only their bones stood there:  and their bones too fell
  <hi type="super">5</hi> to the earth
  and the sheep became few.  And I saw until that twenty-three had undertaken the
  pasturing and completed in their several periods fifty-eight times. <hi type="super">6</hi> But behold lambs
  were borne by those white sheep, and they began to open their eyes and to see,
  <hi type="super">7</hi> and to
  cry to the sheep.  Yea, they cried to them, but they did not hearken to what they said to
  <hi type="super">8</hi>
  them, but were exceedingly deaf, and their eyes were very exceedingly blinded.  And I saw
  in the vision how the ravens flew upon those lambs and took one of those lambs, and
  dashed the sheep <hi type="super">9</hi> in pieces and devoured them.  And I saw till horns grew upon those
  lambs, and the ravens cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of
  one of those sheep, and their eyes <hi type="super">10</hi> were opened.  And it looked at them [and their eyes
  opened], and it cried to the sheep, and the <hi type="super">11</hi> rams saw it and all ran to it.  And
  notwithstanding all this those eagles and vultures and ravens and kites still kept tearing the
  sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them:  still the sheep remained silent,
  but the rams lamented and cried out.  And those ravens fought and battled with it and
  sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it.  All the eagles and vultures and
  ravens and kites were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the
  field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram.
  <hi type="super">19</hi>
  And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all
  the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven fled
  before their face. And I saw that man, who wrote the book according to the command of
  the Lord, till he opened that book concerning the destruction which those twelve last
  shepherds had wrought, and showed that they had destroyed much more than their
  predecessors, before the Lord of the sheep.  And I saw till the Lord of the sheep came
  unto them and took in His hand the staff of His wrath, and smote the earth, and the earth
  clave asunder, and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell from among those
  sheep, and were swallowed up in the earth and it covered them. <hi type="super">20</hi> And I saw till a throne
  was erected in the pleasant land, and the Lord of the sheep sat Himself thereon, and the
  other took the sealed books and opened those books before the Lord of the sheep.
  <hi type="super">21</hi>
  And the Lord called those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they
  should bring before Him, beginning with the first star which led the way, all the stars
  whose privy members <hi type="super">22</hi> were like those of horses, and they brought them all before Him.
  And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and
  said unto him:  ' Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who
  taking them on their own authority slew more <hi type="super">23</hi> than I commanded them.' And behold
  they were all bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him. <hi type="super">24</hi> And the judgement was
  held first over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of
  condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full
  <hi type="super">25</hi> of
  pillars of fire.  And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were
  cast <hi type="super">26</hi> into that fiery abyss.  And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the
  midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all
  judged and found guilty and <hi type="super">27</hi> cast into this fiery abyss, and they burned; now this abyss
  was to the right of that house.  And I saw those sheep burning and their bones burning.
  <hi type="super">28</hi> And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house; and carried off all the pillars,
  and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the same time folded up with it, and
  they carried <hi type="super">29</hi> it off and laid it in a place in the south of the land.  And I saw till the Lord
  of the sheep brought a new house greater and loftier than that first, and set it up in the
  place of the first which had beer folded up:  all its pillars were new, and its ornaments
  were new and larger than those of the first, the old one which He had taken away, and all
  the sheep were within it. <hi type="super">30</hi> And I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts
  on the earth, and all the birds of the heaven, falling down and doing homage to those
  sheep and making petition to and obeying <hi type="super">31</hi> them in every thing.  And thereafter those
  three who were clothed in white and had seized me by my hand [who had taken me up
  before], and the hand of that ram also seizing hold of me, they <hi type="super">32</hi> took me up and set me
  down in the midst of those sheep before the judgement took place.  And those <hi type="super">33</hi> sheep
  were all white, and their wool was abundant and clean.  And all that had been destroyed
  and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, assembled in
  that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good
  and had returned to <hi type="super">34</hi> His house.  And I saw till they laid down that sword, which had
  been given to the sheep, and they brought it back into the house, and it was sealed before
  the presence of the Lord, and all the sheep <hi type="super">35</hi> were invited into that house, but it held
  them not.  And the eyes of them all were opened, and they <hi type="super">36</hi> saw the good, and there was
  not one among them that did not see.  And I saw that that house was large and broad and
  very full. <hi type="super">37</hi> And I saw that a white bull was born, with large horns and all the beasts of
  the field and all the <hi type="super">38</hi> birds of the air feared him and made petition to him all the time.
  And I saw till all their generations were transformed, and they all became white bulls; and
  the first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great
  black horns on its head; and the Lord of the sheep <hi type="super">39</hi> rejoiced over it and over all the
  oxen.  And I slept in their midst:  and I awoke and saw everything. <hi type="super">40</hi> This is the vision
  which I saw while I slept, and I awoke and blessed the Lord of righteousness and
  <hi type="super">41</hi> gave
  Him glory.  Then I wept with a great weeping and my tears stayed not till I could no
  longer endure it:  when I saw, they flowed on account of what I had seen; for everything
  shall come and <hi type="super">42</hi> be fulfilled, and all the deeds of men in their order were shown to me.
  On that night I remembered the first dream, and because of it I wept and was troubled-because I had seen that vision.

  <title>Chapter 104</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> I swear unto you, that in heaven the angels remember you for good before the glory of
  the Great <hi type="super">2</hi> One:  and your names are written before the glory of the Great One.  Be
  hopeful; for aforetime ye were put to shame through ill and affliction; but now ye shall
  shine as the lights of heaven, <hi type="super">3</hi> ye shall shine and ye shall be seen, and the portals of
  heaven shall be opened to you.  And in your cry, cry for judgement, and it shall appear to
  you; for all your tribulation shall be visited on the <hi type="super">4</hi> rulers, and on all who helped those
  who plundered you.  Be hopeful, and cast not away your hopes for ye shall have great joy
  as the angels of heaven.  What shall ye be obliged to do? Ye shall not have to hide on the
  day of the great judgement and ye shall not be found as sinners, and the eternal
  <hi type="super">6</hi>
  judgement shall be far from you for all the generations of the world.  And now fear not, ye
  righteous, when ye see the sinners growing strong and prospering in their ways:  be not
  companions with them, <hi type="super">7</hi> but keep afar from their violence; for ye shall become
  companions of the hosts of heaven.  And, although ye sinners say:  " All our sins shall not
  be searched out and be written down," nevertheless <hi type="super">8</hi> they shall write down all your sins
  every day.  And now I show unto you that light and darkness, <hi type="super">9</hi> day and night, see all your
  sins.  Be not godless in your hearts, and lie not and alter not the words of uprightness, nor
  charge with lying the words of the Holy Great One, nor take account of your <hi type="super">10</hi> idols; for
  all your lying and all your godlessness issue not in righteousness but in great sin.  And now
  I know this mystery, that sinners will alter and pervert the words of righteousness in many
  ways, and will speak wicked words, and lie, and practice great deceits, and write books
  concerning <hi type="super">11</hi> their words.  But when they write down truthfully all my words in their
  languages, and do not change or minish ought from my words but write them all down
  truthfully -all that I first testified <hi type="super">12</hi> concerning them.  Then, I know another mystery, that
  books will be given to the righteous and the <hi type="super">13</hi> wise to become a cause of joy and
  uprightness and much wisdom.  And to them shall the books be given, and they shall
  believe in them and rejoice over them, and then shall all the righteous who have learnt
  therefrom all the paths of uprightness be recompensed.'

  
  <title>Chapter 105</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> In those days the Lord bade (them) to summon and testify to the children of earth
  concerning their wisdom:  Show (it) unto them; for ye are their guides, and a recompense
  over the whole earth. <hi type="super">2</hi> For I and My son will be united with them for ever in the paths of
  uprightness in their lives; and ye shall have peace:  rejoice, ye children of uprightness.
  Amen.


  

   
  <title>Chapter 106</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And after some days my son Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she
  became <hi type="super">2</hi> pregnant by him and bore a son.  And his body was white as snow and red as the
  blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool, and his
  eyes beautiful.  And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like the sun,
  and the whole house <hi type="super">3</hi> was very bright.  And thereupon he arose in the hands of the
  midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of righteousness. <hi type="super">4</hi> And his
  father Lamech was afraid of him and <hi type="super">5</hi> fled, and came to his father Methuselah.  And he
  said unto him:  ' I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike man, and
  resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is not like us,
  and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his <hi type="super">6</hi> countenance is glorious.  And it seems to
  me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels, and I fear that in his days a wonder
  may be <hi type="super">7</hi> wrought on the earth.  And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and
  implore thee that thou mayest go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for
  his dwelling-place is <hi type="super">8</hi> amongst the angels.' And when Methuselah heard the words of his
  son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; for he had heard that 1 was there, and he
  cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to him.  And 1 said unto him:  ' Behold, here
  am I, my son, wherefore hast <hi type="super">9</hi> thou come to me ? ' And he answered and said:  ' Because
  of a great cause of anxiety have I come to thee, and because of a disturbing vision
  <hi type="super">10</hi> have
  I approached.  And now, my father, hear me:  unto Lamech my son there hath been born a
  son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like man's nature, and the colour
  of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his
  head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his
  eyes and <hi type="super">11</hi> thereupon lighted up the whole house.  And he arose in the hands of the
  midwife, and opened 12 his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven.  And his father
  Lamech became afraid and fled to me, and did not believe that he was sprung from him,
  but that he was in the likeness of the angels of heaven; and behold I have come to thee that
  thou mayest make known to me the truth.' And I, Enoch, answered and said unto him:
  'The Lord will do a new thing on the earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and
  make known to thee that in the generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven
  transgressed the word of the Lord.  And behold they commit sin and transgress the law,
  and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married
  some of them, and have begot children by them.  And they shall produce on the earth
  giants not according to the spirit, but according to the flesh, and there shall be a great
  punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed from all impurity.  Yea, there shall
  come a great destruction over the whole earth, and there shall be a deluge and
  <hi type="super">16</hi> a great
  destruction for one year.  And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the
  earth, and his three children shall be saved with him:  when all mankind that are on the
  earth <hi type="super">18</hi> shall die [he and his sons shall be saved].  And now make known to thy son
  Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah; for he shall
  be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved from the destruction, which shall come
  upon the earth on account of all the sin and all the unrighteousness, which shall be
  consummated on the earth in his days.  And after that there shall be still more
  unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the earth; for I know the
  mysteries of the holy ones; for He, the Lord, has showed me and informed me, and I have
  read (them) in the heavenly tablets.

  
  <title>Chapter 107</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> And I saw written on them that generation upon generation shall transgress, till a
  generation of righteousness arises, and transgression is destroyed and sin passes away
  from the earth, and all <hi type="super">2</hi> manner of good comes upon it.  And now, my son, go and make
  known to thy son Lamech that this <hi type="super">3</hi> son, which has been born, is in truth his son, and that
  (this) is no lie.' And when Methuselah had heard the words of his father Enoch-for he had
  shown to him everything in secret-he returned and showed (them) to him and called the
  name of that son Noah; for he will comfort the earth after all the destruction.

  
  <title>Chapter 108</title>

  <hi type="super">1</hi> Another book which Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who will come
  after him, <hi type="super">2</hi> and keep the law in the last days.  Ye who have done good shall wait for those
  days till an end is made of those who work evil; and an end of the might of the
  transgressors.  And wait ye indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be blotted
  out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed for
  ever, and their spirits shall be slain, and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place that
  is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for there is no earth there.  And I
  saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason of its depth I could not look
  over, and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things like shining <hi type="super">5</hi> mountains circling
  and sweeping to and fro.  And I asked one of the holy angels who was with me and said
  unto him:  ' What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven but only the flame of a blazing
  <hi type="super">6</hi> fire, and the voice of weeping and crying and lamentation and strong pain.' And he said
  unto me:  ' This place which thou seest-here are cast the spirits of sinners and blasphemers,
  and of those who work wickedness, and of those who pervert everything that the Lord
  hath spoken through the mouth <hi type="super">7</hi> of the prophets-(even) the things that shall be.  For some
  of them are written and inscribed above in the heaven, in order that the angels may read
  them and know that which shall befall the sinners, and the spirits of the humble, and of
  those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed <hi type="super">8</hi> by God; and of those who
  have been put to shame by wicked men:  Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver
  nor any of the good things which are in the world, but gave over their bodies to torture.
  Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food, but regarded everything as
  a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits
  were <hi type="super">10</hi> found pure so that they should bless His name.  And all the blessings destined for
  them I have recounted in the books.  And he hath assigned them their recompense,
  because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world,
  and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and
  reviling from them and were put to shame, <hi type="super">11</hi> yet they blessed Me.  And now I will
  summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform
  those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed <hi type="super">12</hi> with such
  honour as their faithfulness deserved.  And I will bring forth in shining light those who
  <hi type="super">13</hi>
  have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour.  And they shall
  be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to
  the faithful <hi type="super">14</hi> He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths.  And they shall
  see those who were , <hi type="super">15</hi> born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be
  resplendent.  And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed
  will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.'
